# Conditions

## Close Combat

When you share a square with an enemy, you are considered to be in Close Combat. In such a situation, Brawling checks and weapon proficiency rolls with Light weapons gain advantage while those with Two Handed weapons or Large Shields suffer disadvantage. It is not possible to use Oversize weapons or the Counterattack reaction in Close Combat. 

## Off Hand

When using your off hand, you suffer disadvantage on offensive combat maneuvers made with light weapons or natural attacks and triple disadvantage on offensive combat maneuvers using one-handed or thrown weapons. 

## Prone

When prone, you suffer disadvantage on all melee attack rolls made at creatures with whom you are not in Close Combat. You also suffer disadvantage on all defensive combat maneuvers. For the purpose of calculating reach requirements for both your attacks and attacks targeted at you, all of your target wheels are considered to be at the vertical level of your lowest target wheel. For example, a prone humanoid would calculate the reach of all of their attacks from the level of their shins.


## Grabbed

When Grabbed by an opponent, if you attempt to move, you must make a Brawn or Escape Artist check contested by your opponent’s Grip. The opponent gains advantage for each appendage grabbing you beyond the first.
*Critical failure: Your movement fails.
*Success: Your movement may occur at half speed, but you do not break the Grab. The opponent may choose to spend a reaction to move with you if you leave their reach. In this case, neither your movement nor your opponent’s provoke attacks of opportunity from the other. 
*Critical Success: You break free and are no longer Grabbed. Your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity from the Grabbing opponent. 

If you attempt to take any other physical action or reaction using the Grabbed location you must first make a Brawn or Escape Artist check contested by your opponent’s Grip. The opponent gains advantage for each appendage grabbing relevant hit locations beyond the first.
*Critical Failure: You do nothing and lose your action or reaction.
*Failure: You may take your action at disadvantage. 
*Success: You may take your action at no penalty, but are still Grabbed.
*Critical Success: You break free and are no longer Grabbed.

You may also spend an action to break free. In this case you make a Brawn or Escape Artist check with advantage contested by your opponent’s Grip. The opponent gains advantage for each appendage grabbing relevant hit locations beyond the first. 
*Success: You gain advantage on checks to escape or resist the Grab until the beginning of your next turn.
*Critical Success: You break free and are no longer Grabbed.
