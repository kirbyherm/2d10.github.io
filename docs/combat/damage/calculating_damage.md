# Calculating Damage

Once you have hit a target with a weapon attack and determined the hit location, you roll for damage. Damages for weapon attacks comes from four sources:
1. All weapons have a base damage. 
2. For each level of proficiency you have with the weapon, you deal an additional die of damage. The die is the same as the type of die used in the weapon’s base damage, which is based on the weapon’s complexity and handedness.
3. Deal additional damage based on your strength and weapon, using the multipliers from the table below. 
4. Any additional damage from magical abilities, talents, or the weapon itself.

|Strength multipliers|Oversize|Two Handed|One Handed|Light

|Bludgeoning|3|2.5|2|1.5
