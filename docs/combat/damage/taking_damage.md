# Taking Damage

Throughout combat, keep a running total of the total damage that you have taken. At the beginning of a new round, after accounting for additional Bleed damage, you must make a Stamina, Morale, or Grit check with a DC equal to your total damage taken if the total damage is at least 10. If you have taken fewer than 10 points of damage, you may choose whether you want to roll.

* Critical Success: Reset your damage taken to zero.
* Success: Nothing happens.
* Failure: You gain a level of Fatigue (see below) and reset your damage taken to 0.
* Critical Failure: You gain two levels of Fatigue and reset your damage taken to 0..

|Invigorated|Feeling far better than normal. Either very well rested or magically enhanced.|
|Rested|This is the default state.|
|Weary|Noticeably more tired than normal, but not enough to meaningfully affect actions.|
|Fatigued|Disadvantage on all rolls.|
|Exhausted|Lose an action.|
|Unconscious|You cannot take actions.|


Injured characters that become Exhausted in combat (especially those with significant fluid loss) may begin to show signs of stage I shock such as confusion and dizziness while those who become unconscious may progress to later stages and are likely to die without medical attention. If an injury or condition asks you to roll against shock (such as damage to internal organs or sepsis) or if you fall unconscious in combat, make a DC 10 Health check.

* Critical Success: You do not immediately go into shock. If the malady is not treated and requires additional shock tests in the future, you gain advantage on those checks.
* Success: You enter stage I shock. Your maximum fatigue level becomes Exhausted until you receive treatment as you feel faint, dizzy, and confused. Without medical attention, you will progress to stage II shock in 1d10 hours.
* Failure: You enter stage II shock and fall unconscious. Your pulse is very weak and you will progress to stage III shock in 2d6 minutes.
* Critical Failure: You enter stage III shock and fall unconscious. This stage usually lasts less than a minute and invariably leads to death. In the unlikely event of recovery, massive brain damage will usually have occurred.

If you are knocked Unconscious but do not go into shock, you will become Exhausted in 2d4 rounds.
