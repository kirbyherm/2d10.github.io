# Draw Cut
You make a slashing attack with disadvantage at a target wheel with a bladed weapon, contested by the target’s defensive maneuver. 
* Failure and Critical Failure: Result depends on the target’s defensive maneuver.
* Success: The attack hits the target wheel, 1d12 to determine the location hit and apply weapon damage. If the hit location is not protected by Hard armor, increase the bleed multiplier by 0.5.
* Critical Success: As success, and you critically strike.
