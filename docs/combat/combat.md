# Overview of combat

At the beginning of combat, all characters declare an opening style and make an Initiative check using either their Combat Reflexes or Combat Awareness. If you choose an offensive (defensive) style, you gain advantage (suffer disadvantage) on your initiative check. Combat proceeds from highest to lowest initiative with PCs taking their turns before NPCs at the same initiative count. If PCs tie, they may choose in what order they wish to take their turns. A character who is unaware of the combat cannot take reactions, whereas a character who is aware but has not yet taken an action suffers disadvantage on all reactions.

All characters receive three actions per turn.
