System-level mechanics
======================

### Skill checks

All skill checks are 2d10 + proficiency + ability + magic + other -
penalties. Unless otherwise specified, multiple magical effects that add
to a die roll overlap rather than stack. Penalties arise primarily from
encumbrance and wounds. The result is then compared to the Difficulty
Class (DC) of the attempted action in the case. This may be a static
number in the case of an individual action, or the result of an opposed
check if it is a contest between multiple characters. If the result
meets or exceeds the DC, the check is a Success. If it exceeds the DC by
at least 10, it is a Critical Success. If it is below the DC, it is a
Failure, or a Critical Failure if it is at least 10 below the DC. For
example, if the DC is 15, a Critical Success would be 25 or higher, a
Success from 15 to 24, a Failure from 4 to 14, and a Critical Failure at
5 or below. A tie is considered a success for a non-contested action. In
the case of a contested action, a tie is a success for the party that
rolled second (in most cases, the defender), since the initial roll
(e.g. the attack roll) sets the DC. In the case of simultaneous rolls
where there is not an identifiable initiator, a tie represents a tie or
no change.

Rather than fitting into four categories, some rolls have more variable
outcomes, called the degree of success or failure. If your check exceeds
the DC, your degree of success is equal to your check result minus the
DC. If you fail to meet the DC, your degree of failure is equal to the
DC minus your check result. For example, if you Critically Succeed on a
Strike (by exceeding the target's defensive combat maneuver result by 10
or more), you add your degree of success to your damage rolls.

Many abilities and maneuvers will grant you advantage or disadvantage.
When you have advantage on a roll, you roll an additional d10 and
disregard the lowest die, whereas when you have disadvantage you roll an
additional d10 and disregard the highest die. Advantage and disadvantage
stack up to three times, which would involve rolling 5d10 and taking the
highest two results or lowest two results, respectively. Advantage and
disadvantage are subtractive, meaning that if you have two sources of
advantage and one source of disadvantage, the disadvantage cancels out
one advantage and the net result is that you make the roll with
advantage. If you would suffer at least four levels of (net)
disadvantage on a roll, you automatically critically fail instead.

### Supporting an action

One common method of gaining advantage is supporting another character's
action using an appropriate skill. For example, an inspiring ally may
attempt to support a party member's Climb check with their Leadership by
giving a pep talk. When attempting a Support action, make a check with
the supporting skill. In most cases, the DC will be 10 in combat or 15
out of combat, but the GM may determine a higher or lower DC depending
on the difficulty of the task or the salience of the supporting skill,
as well as whether the support attempt is possible. For example, an
artificer attempting a very difficult Arcana check to reprogram an
eldritch machine may not find the party minstrel's inspirational comedy
routine to be particularly helpful.

-   Critical Failure: The target suffers disadvantage on their action.

-   Failure: There is no effect.

-   Success: The target gains advantage on their action.

-   Critical Success: The target gains double advantage on their action.

An action may be supported by as many allies as is reasonable, though
only the outcome from the best support attempt applies. Outside of
combat, players are encouraged to be creative in their attempts to
support their allies and certain abilities or actions may allow you to
support your own actions. In combat, the ability to support skills is
more limited; support attempts typically require an action and
appropriate actions are codified in the combat rules.

Sometimes the ability to perform an action is limited by your
capabilities in a separate skill, this is called a limited roll. In such
a situation, you suffer double disadvantage on the primary skill roll
but it is supported by the limiting skill (meaning that if you
critically succeed on the supporting roll, you do not suffer any
disadvantage on the primary roll). For example, defensive combat
maneuvers against an attack from behind are limited by your Combat
Awareness or Combat Reflexes, and a Persuasion check may be limited by
your Etiquette at a high class party. In some situations, a separate
character may be able to perform the limiting skill check. For example,
if a character is foraging in Lamannia, the results of their Provision
check may be limited by the results of a Knowledge (Cosmology) check
made by either themselves or an extraplanar guide.

### Inhibiting an Action

Inhibiting an action is the opposite of supporting. Certain abilities
may let you use one of your skills to inhibit the actions of an
adversary. Such a check may be at a fixed DC (similar to a support
check), but is more commonly contested by an adversary's skill.

-   Critical Failure: The target suffers no disadvantage.

-   Failure: The target suffers disadvantage on their action.

-   Success: The target suffers double disadvantage on their action.

-   Critical Success: The target suffers triple disadvantage on their
    > action.

Combat Mode
===========

General combat rules
--------------------

### Initiative

At the beginning of combat, all characters make an Initiative check
using either their Combat Reflexes or Combat Awareness. Combat proceeds
from highest to lowest initiative with PCs taking their turns before
NPCs at the same initiative count. If PCs tie, they may choose in what
order they wish to take their turns. A character who is unaware of the
combat cannot take reactions, whereas a character who is aware but has
not yet taken an action suffers disadvantage on all reactions. Whenever
a creature takes a reaction, their initiative value is reduced by one.
If they have already acted this round, this does not take effect until
the following round. All characters receive three actions per turn that
may be spent on a variety of activities detailed below. Each time a
character takes a reaction, their initiative score is reduced by one
starting in the current round if they have not already acted or in the
following round if they have.

### Size, Reach, and Hit Locations

Creatures are divided into size categories of diminutive, tiny, small,
medium, large, huge, gargantuan, and colossal. For bipeds, a small
creatures is typically 2' to 4' tall and medium creature 4' to 8' tall.
Each size category difference up or down similarly multiplies or divides
these bounds by two. The basic combat rules are for interacting with
targets within two size categories of yourself. If the size difference
between you and your target is three or more size categories, special
rules apply. If the attacker and defender are not the same size
category, that larger party receives advantage on initiating or
resisting Beat, Bind, Block, Disarm, Drive, Grapple, Shove, and Trip
attempts or triple advantage if they are two size categories larger.

Creatures have different reach, measured in half-foot increments. For
bipedal creatures, your base reach is equal to half of your height
rounded down to the nearest half foot. Weapons, special abilities and
spells may modify this reach. Weapons modify it additively, meaning that
you add the reach of your weapon to your base reach to determine your
reach with that weapon. You need at least 5 feet of reach to target an
adjacent square. Each square beyond that requires an additional 5 feet
of reach. Diagonals cost more and can be checked using Roll20's
measurement tool.

When you use a melee offensive combat maneuver, the wheel that you
target affects the reach of your attack. Your effective reach is reduced
by the difference between the height of your attacking target wheel and
the nearest border of the selected target wheel. Most attacks originate
from the Arms (for example, held weapons or punches), but may be Head
for a bite attack or Lower Torso for a kick.

![](media/image2.png){width="5.276042213473316in"
height="3.8584722222222223in"}

The diagram above shows the reach penalty zones for a medium size
character attacking each target wheel of a small, medium, and large
sized opponent. The attacker suffers no reach penalty when attacking
anywhere but the legs of a medium opponent, the Head of a small
opponent, or the lower torso or legs of a large opponent (blue zones).
For a medium opponent, the attacker would reduce their effective reach
by 1.5 when attacking either leg. They would face this same penalty
attacking the Lower Torso of a small opponent of the Upper Torso or Arms
of a large opponent (yellow zones). Additionally they would suffer a 0.5
foot reach penalty against the Upper Torso or Arms of a small opponent
(green), a 2.5 foot penalty targeting the legs of a small opponent
(orange), or a 4.5' penalty when attacking the Head of a large opponent
(red). These values are all based on the average height of a creature
within a given size category and apply in most cases, regardless of the
actual height of the creatures in question.

The hit location that you target also affects your accuracy and your
opponent's ability to defend. You gain advantage on melee attacks
against the target's center mass (typically the Upper and Lower Torso
for humanoids and beasts), and disadvantage on attacks against the Head.

Smaller targets are harder to hit. You gain advantage on all attack
rolls targeted at creatures of a larger size category and disadvantage
against creatures of a smaller size category, or triple (dis)advantage
if there is a two size category difference. However, size also affects
how hard a hit you can take. All physical damage is scaled by size
category. For each size category above the attacker's, damage is reduced
by a third; for each size category below, damage is increased by half.
This is done by selecting the "Target Size" before rolling damage. Apply
damage reduction and precision damage bonuses (such as crit damage)
after applying the size multiplier to damage.

### Facing

Most creatures have a direction towards which their attention and
appendages are focused, represented by the arrow around them on the map.
For medium and small characters, their front is three squares, flanks
are one square on either side, and rear is three squares. Facing defines
the area that the creature can most directly affect with actions and
respond to with reactions. Each hand may typically affect a creature's
front and the flank corresponding to the side of the hand without
penalty. Offensive maneuvers that are not dependent on a hand can affect
targets in a creature's front, while hands-free defensive combat
maneuvers like Dodge can affect the front or flanks without penalty. For
each square outside of this preferred range, actions and reactions
suffer disadvantage.

Before you take an action or reaction, you may change your facing. If
you turn more than 90 degrees, any roll associated with that action or
reaction suffers disadvantage. Different movement actions have different
rules regarding facing; for example, Sprinting must typically be done
toward your front, while taking a Guarded Move means you move at half
speed but can change your facing throughout the move and may move in any
direction. If you are attacked from the rear (or the sides if you are
wearing a helm), any defensive combat maneuvers are limited by your
Combat Reflexes or Combat Awareness.

Facing is also important for attacks of opportunity as detailed in
Attacks of Opportunities in the Reactions section.

For each size category above medium, the front, rear, and each flank
include one additional square. The disadvantage for taking actions or
reactions outside of these areas likewise allows for one additional
square for each size category above medium.

### Shields

Each shield shape has a set of target wheels for which they provide
standard cover. When you attempt a block check to defend your head, you
must raise your shield. You may also choose to raise or lower your
shield once per round during your turn without spending an action. While
your shield is raised, the lowest target wheel in your shield's Standard
Cover (noted in parentheses) is replaced with your Head. However,
against opponents in (and behind) your shield's primary zone, you suffer
disadvantage on combat maneuvers and do not threaten attacks of
opportunity. You lower your shield when you block any attack not in your
(new) Standard Cover or if you choose to do so during your turn.

Facing is particularly important for shields. Of the four squares
comprising a character's front and shield-side flank, the center two
squares are considered to be the shield's primary zone. You
automatically succeed at Block checks (with no need to roll) against all
attacks from those squares (and from those directions for projectile and
area of effect attacks) that would otherwise hit a target wheel within
your shield's range of standard cover. The diagram to the right
represents a medium character fighting with a shield in its left hand.
The dark blue is the shield's primary zone, where attacks against target
wheels in their standard cover are automatically Blocked.
![](media/image1.png){width="0.6354166666666666in"
height="1.0520833333333333in"}

### Cover

Cover operates similarly to shields. When defining cover, the GM and
players establish which target wheels are covered and from which
directions. Attacks from these directions that hit the target wheel
automatically hit the cover instead (although excess damage may hit the
character afterwards). Attacks aimed at target wheels adjacent to
covered wheels suffer disadvantage.

Other creatures can provide cover and can therefore be hit accidentally.
This most commonly occurs when you fire a ranged weapon into melee
combat and the risk of doing so should be clear before making the
attack. The GM determines what target wheel or hit location of the
covering creature is at risk based on the orientation of the covering
and covered creatures. After determining who and where the attack may
hit, you redetermine the level of advantage of the attack, which may
change the DC of defensive combat maneuvers for the covering creature.
For example, advantage gained by taking the Aim action at an enemy would
no longer apply if you accidentally hit an ally in the back.

### Fighting in Poor Conditions

When fighting in poor conditions, participant skill matters less and
more is up to chance. The most common causes for poor conditions are low
light and darkness, weather conditions, and magical abilities. During an
opposed roll, the GM should assess whether each side faces a moderate or
severe impairment from the conditions. For example, a moderate
impairment may be caused by low light or heavy mist, while severe
impairment may be caused by darkness or fighting on a ship in a storm.

After a fixed or opposed roll occurs in which either side is impaired,
an involved player rolls a d6. If the player's character is moderately
(severely) impaired, on a result of 1 (or 2), the player's category or
success is reduced by one. If the target of an opposed check is
moderately (severely) impaired, on a result of 6 (or 5), the player's
category of success is increased by one.

For example, if you attack an enemy on a ship in a major storm, both
characters are by default severely impaired by the ship's movements.
After accounting for your opponents defensive combat maneuver, you have
Succeeded on the attack. To check for impairment, you roll a d6. On a 1
or 2, you Fail while on a 5 or 6 you Critically Succeed instead.
However, if you are instead fighting a pirate who is used to these
conditions and is therefore only moderately impaired, you would still
Fail on a 1 or 2, but you would only Critically Succeed on a 6.

Severe asymmetric impairment may also result in different ranges. In
situations where the attacker is impaired and the defender is
unimpaired, the impairment d6 is rolled before the defender declares
their reaction (if any). In situations where the effect of the
impairment is strongly asymmetric or particularly severe, the GM should
apply disadvantage or prohibit certain actions instead or in addition to
these rules. For example, severe wind buffeting two characters in melee
combat may call for an impairment check as the effect is symmetric and
most combat actions are still possible. However, a character trying to
shoot a bow may end up doing so at double disadvantage rather than using
the impairment rules.

### Non-Wound Penalties

#### Multi Use Penalties (MUPs)

It is more challenging to use the same body parts for different
activities in quick succession; this is modeled using Multi Use
Penalties (or MUPs). Almost any activity that is not purely mental or
vocal requires you to apply a Right Hand, Left Hand, Mobility, or Magic
MUP. The applicable MUP has two effects: (1) It applies penalties from
previous MUPs as well as Encumbrance and Wounds to your roll, and (2) It
adds the MUP associated with your current action to your MUP tracker for
future rolls this round. MUPs reset at the end of the round and can also
be reduced using the Reset and Focused Reset actions.

There are two rollers on the character sheet that apply MUPs in
different ways. The top roller allows you to select any skill and roll
it. This roller uses the checkboxes in the MUP box below it to both
determine and assign MUPs. A check is required for every default
Strength, Dexterity, and Agility-based skill (except for Combat
Reflexes), as well as Vehicles (any), Creature Handling, Surgery,
Treatment, and Concocting (any). If you try to roll for any of these
skill without a MUP selected (or roll for any other skill with a MUP
selected), you will receive a pop-up asking if you are sure.

In contrast, the bottom roller pulls from the customizable ability table
at the bottom of your character sheet. When you are setting up lines for
the actions that you want to have available (likely including any
appropriate offensive combat maneuvers, shields, in-combat spells, and
other special actions granted by talents), you select the MUPs that
apply to that ability. For example, for a Longsword Slash, you would
select the Right and Left MUP in the table and it would automatically be
applied whenever you roll the Longsword Slash in the lower roller.

#### Encumbrance

Wearing armor and carrying a heavy load both limit your movement,
reflected in the form of encumbrance penalties. Each hit location that a
piece of armor covers is associated with a base penalty for either Right
Hand, Left Hand, or Mobility. Physically larger areas and joints have
higher base values. This base value is then multiplied by a value based
on the weight and maneuverability of the armor's material; e.g. Plate
armor is more restricted than Segmented Leather armor. The products of
the hit location base value and the armor material multiplier are summed
for each armor set. The total is then divided by 1 + Brawn modifier/10,
representing the fact that a stronger character is less bothered by
heavy armor. This total is calculated and displayed for each armor set
on the character's Stat page.

Encumbrance can also arise from the weight of items tracked on your
Inventory page. Your Total Effective Carried Bulk may result in
penalties to physical actions and is calculated as the sum of the bulk
of readily accessible objects and the bulk of backpack items adjusted by
the backpack's bulk multiplier all adjusted by your Brawn factor
(1+Brawn mod/10) and rounded down. Every four points of Total Effective
Carried Bulk results in a -1 penalty to Mobility checks and every 10
points results in a -1 penalty to Left and Right hand checks. For more
detail on calculating Total Effective Carried Bulk, see the Encumbrance
and Inventory section.

#### Wounds

The wound penalty scales cubically from -1 for a 10-damage wound to a
-10 penalty for the maximum damage of that hit location. The penalties
are tracked similarly to MUP or Encumbrance penalties. Each category
(Right, Left, Mobility, Magic) only receives the full penalty from
wounds to particular groups of hit locations as shown on the table
below, and half of the penalty (rounded down) from all other hit
locations.

  **MUP Category**   **Full Wound Value**
  ------------------ -----------------------
  Right              Head, Body, Right Arm
  Left               Head, Body, Left Arm
  Mobility           Head, Body, Legs
  Magic              Head

#### Effect of Penalties on Movement Speed

The sum of your Encumbrance and Wound Mobility penalties is subtracted
from your base movement speed and then rounded up to the nearest 5-foot
increment. Mobility MUPs do not affect movement speed.

### Conditions Definitions

#### Close Combat

When you share a square with an enemy, you are considered to be in Close
Combat. In such a situation, Brawling checks and weapon proficiency
rolls with Light weapons gain advantage while those with Two Handed
weapons or Large Shields suffer disadvantage. It is not possible to use
Oversize weapons or the Counterattack reaction in Close Combat. You
receive advantage on Parry attempts if your reach is shorter than that
of the attacking weapon, instead of longer and you cannot typically
attack target wheels that would result in a reach penalty. There is no
minimum reach required to attack a target in Close Combat.

#### Off Hand

When using your off hand, you suffer disadvantage on offensive combat
maneuvers made with light weapons or natural attacks and triple
disadvantage on offensive combat maneuvers using one-handed or thrown
weapons.

#### Prone

When prone, you suffer disadvantage on all melee attack rolls made at
creatures with whom you are not in Close Combat and do not threaten
attacks of opportunity outside of your own square. You also suffer
disadvantage on all defensive combat maneuvers. For the purpose of
calculating reach requirements for both your attacks and attacks
targeted at you, all of your target wheels are considered to be at the
vertical level of your lowest target wheel. For example, a prone
humanoid would calculate the reach of all of their attacks from the
level of their legs. Ranged attacks against a prone target typically
suffer at least one level of disadvantage or may be impossible based on
terrain.

#### Grabbed

When Grabbed by an opponent, if you attempt to move, you must make a
Brawn or Escape Artist check contested by your opponent's Grip. The
opponent gains advantage for each appendage grabbing you beyond the
first.

-   Critical failure: Your movement fails.

-   Success: Your movement may occur at half speed, but you do not break
    > the Grab. The opponent may choose to spend a reaction to move with
    > you if you leave their reach. In this case, neither your movement
    > nor your opponent's provoke attacks of opportunity from the other.

-   Critical Success: You break free and are no longer Grabbed. Your
    > movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity from the Grabbing
    > opponent.

If you attempt to take any other physical action or reaction using the
Grabbed location you must first make a Brawn or Escape Artist check
contested by your opponent's Grip. The opponent gains advantage for each
appendage grabbing relevant hit locations beyond the first.

-   Critical Failure: You do nothing and lose your action or reaction.

-   Failure: You may take your action at disadvantage.

-   Success: You may take your action at no penalty, but are still
    > Grabbed.

-   Critical Success: You break free and are no longer Grabbed.

You may also spend an action to break free. In this case you make a
Brawn or Escape Artist check with advantage contested by your opponent's
Grip. The opponent gains advantage for each appendage grabbing relevant
hit locations beyond the first.

-   Success: You gain advantage on checks to escape or resist the Grab
    > until the beginning of your next turn.

-   Critical Success: You break free and are no longer Grabbed.

Damage
------

### Calculating Attack Damage

Once you have hit a target with a weapon attack, you roll for damage.
Damages for weapon attacks comes from four sources:

1.  All weapons have a base damage.

2.  For each level of proficiency you have with the weapon, you deal an
    > additional die of damage. The die is the same as the type of die
    > used in the weapon's base damage, which is based on the weapon's
    > complexity and handedness.

3.  Deal additional damage based on your strength and weapon, using the
    > multipliers from the table below.

4.  Any additional damage from magical abilities, talents, or the weapon
    > itself.

Additionally, all physical damage is scaled by size category. For each
size category above the attacker's, damage is reduced by a third; for
each size category below, damage is increased by half. This is done by
selecting the "Target Size" before rolling damage. Apply damage
reduction and precision damage bonuses (such as crit damage) after
applying the size multiplier to damage.

  Strength multipliers   Oversize   Two Handed   One Handed   Light
  ---------------------- ---------- ------------ ------------ -------
  Flexible                                       1            0.5
  Composite              1.5        1            0.5          0.5
  Bludgeoning            2          1.5          1            0.5
  Swung Piercing         2          1.5          1            0.5
  Cleaving               2          1.5          1            0.5
  Slashing Blade         1.5        1            0.5          0.5
  Thrusting Blade        1          1            0.5          0.5
  Thrusting              1          1            0.5          0.5

After calculating the total damage and applying size modifiers, the
target reduces the damage taken by their Armor Value (AV). AV is
specific to both the damage type (Slashing, Piercing, Bludgeoning, or
Elemental) as well as the hit location. Each point of the corresponding
AV reduces the damage taken by 1, to a minimum of 0. Damage is recorded
additively on the character's sheet. If you take at least 10 damage from
a single attack, you suffer a Wound in addition to the damage.

Many attacks deal multiple types of damage. Most commonly, a weapon that
deals Slashing or Piercing as its primary damage will also deal
secondary (and lower) Bludgeoning damage. In this case, report both
damage totals, e.g. "That deals 32 Slashing damage or 14 Bludgeoning
damage." AV is applied to both totals and only the higher number is
dealt as damage, although if both damage totals are 10 or higher, the
target tracks both wounds separately. For example, in the above case if
the target had 18 Slashing AV and 8 Bludgeoning AV in the hit location,
they would only take 14 damage and mark down a single wound.

### Fatigue from Actions

Many actions that you take in combat are tiring. Most offensive combat
maneuvers, Swim and Sprint checks also deal a small amount of fatigue
damage to you. This damage is tracked identically to damage from
external sources and is in most cases automatically calculated and
applied. Each weapon has a base fatigue cost ranging from 1 (a punch or
dagger thrust) to 4 (a Poleaxe swing), while Swim and Sprint checks have
a base value of 2 per action. This cost is divided by a factor of 1 +
(Strength + Matching Skill or Brawn proficiency bonus)/10, which is a
modified version of your general Brawn factor.

If a character runs out of mana, they may continue to cast spells but
the effect is taxing on the body. Any mana cost that exceeds a
character's remaining mana pool is instead added as fatigue damage.

### Additional Effects

#### Taking Wounds

Whenever you suffer at least 10 physical damage from a single attack,
the attack was substantial or painful enough to have more long-lasting
consequences. Such attacks generate wounds, which are tracked on your
character sheet. When you suffer a wound, in addition to adding the
damage to your damage total, you must input the initial value (damage
taken), the type (S for Slashing, P for Piercing, B for Bludgeoning, or
E for Elemental), and the Hit Location into the Wound Tracker. The Wound
tracker will automatically display the Bleed damage, the Disruption (if
any), and the penalty associated with the wound.

#### Maximum Damage

Damage to any given hit location is capped at the value given on the
table below. Areas on the torso and head (marked with an asterisk)
result in an instant death if maximum damage is dealt to them. For other
hit locations, the limb is likely severed at this point if the damage
was Slashing or otherwise mangled to the point of unusability for other
types of damage until it receives medical attention.

#### Bleed

Slashing and piercing attacks that deal at least 10 points of damage
leave an open wound that results in bleeding damage at the beginning of
each turn until the bleeding is stopped. This damage is 1d6, plus an
additional 1d6 damage for every 5 points by which the damage exceeds 10,
plus a possible modifier based on the hit location as listed in the
table below. The hit location bleed modifier does not apply if the hit
location is Dismembered (see above). For example, if an attack deals 33
points of slashing damage to the target's elbow, the target would take
30 damage as their arm is Dismembered at the elbow, and they would take
5d6 points of bleed damage per round.

#### Disruption

Whenever you take at least 10 points of Bludgeoning damage, you must
make a check to avoid possible disruption at a DC equal to the
Bludgeoning damage taken. Whenever you take at least 20 points of any
other type of damage, you must make a check to avoid possible disruption
at a DC equal to the half of the damage taken. If a single attack
exceeds both of these thresholds, you only make one check at the higher
DC. This can take the form of Knockout, Drop, or Knockdown, as described
on the table below. Some hit locations are more or less disruptive, and
you may gain Advantage or Disadvantage on the check as indicated on the
table. The type of disruption and level of (dis)advantage are displayed
in the wound tracker on your character sheet.

-   Knockout: The target must make a Health or Grit check.

    -   Critical Success: No effect.

    -   Success: The target loses one action and suffers disadvantage on
        > all checks until the end of their next turn.

    -   Failure: As success, and the target becomes Unconscious.

    -   Critical failure: The target dies.

-   Drop: The target must make a Grip or proficiency with the held item
    > check.

    -   Critical Success: No effect.

    -   Success: The target suffers disadvantage on all checks made with
        > that arm until the end of their next turn.

    -   Failure: As success, and the target drops any items held using
        > that arm.

    -   Critical Failure: As failure, except that the target may not
        > attempt any Dexterity, Athletics or Brawn checks until the end
        > of their next turn.

-   Knockdown: The target must make a Stability or Balance check.

    -   Critical Success: No effect.

    -   Success: The target's speed is halved and they suffer
        > disadvantage on all Agility, Athletics and Stability checks
        > until the end of their next turn.

    -   Failure: As success, except that the target is knocked prone.

    -   Critical Failure: The target is knocked prone and may not move
        > until the end of their next turn.

Most weapon attacks deal Bludgeoning damage in addition to either
Slashing or Piercing damage. In such cases, both damage rolls are
compared to the target's damage reduction to determine final damage
values. The target takes damage equal to the higher of the values, but
each value causes wounds and additional effects separately. If an attack
forces a Disruption check based on its Bludgeoning damage and deals more
Piercing or Slashing damage than Bludgeoning, the target makes the
Disruption check with disadvantage. For example, an axe blow that deals
16 Slashing damage and 11 Bludgeoning damage to the upper arm would deal
16 damage to the target and result in a DC 16 Slashing wound and a DC 11
Bludgeoning wound. The target would take 2d6 points of bleed damage per
round and would need to make a DC 11 Grip or item proficiency check with
disadvantage to avoid dropping whatever was held in that arm.

### Taking Damage, Fatigue, and Blood Loss

The Start Combat button sets your combat fatigue level to be equal to
your base fatigue level. Your combat fatigue level may never be lower
than your base fatigue level unless an effect specifies otherwise.
Throughout combat, keep a running total of the total damage that you
have taken. At the beginning of a new round, hitting the Start Turn
button will roll a Stamina, Morale, or Grit check with a DC equal to
your total damage taken and update your damage total and combat fatigue
level.

-   Critical Success: Reset your damage taken to zero.

-   Success: Nothing happens.

-   Failure: You gain a level of Fatigue (see below) and reset your
    > damage taken to 0.

-   Critical Failure: You gain two levels of Fatigue and reset your
    > damage taken to 0.

  Invigorated   Feeling far better than normal. Either very well rested or magically enhanced.
  ------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Rested        This is the default state.
  Weary         Noticeably more tired than normal, but not enough to meaningfully affect actions.
  Fatigued      Disadvantage on all rolls.
  Exhausted     Disadvantage on all rolls and lose an action.
  Unconscious   You cannot take actions.

Injured characters that become Exhausted in combat (especially those
with significant fluid loss) may begin to show signs of shock such as
confusion and dizziness while those who become unconscious with bleeding
wounds are likely to die without medical attention. If you fall
unconscious in combat you make a DC 5 Health check to determine how long
it is before you wake up on your own.

-   Critical Success: 1d10 rounds.

-   Success: 1d10 minutes.

-   Failure: 1d6 x 10 minutes.

-   Critical Failure: 1d10 hours.

The resulting time is rolled by the DM and is not known to the players.
If an adjacent character uses an action to attempt to wake you up, you
wake up if you have less than half of the rolled time remaining.

While unconscious, bleeding wounds continue to bleed. Continue to hit
the start turn button each round. The total bleed dice of all of your
wounds will result in per-round blood loss as shown on the table below
(minimum 0). If your total blood loss exceeds 100 + 10 x Body Control
bonus, you die.

  Bleed Dice   Blood Loss   Average Time
  ------------ ------------ --------------
  2            1d6-5        1 Hour
  3            1d6-3        20 Minutes
  4            1d6-2        8 Minutes
  5            1d6-1        4 Minutes
  6            1d6+1        2.5 Minutes
  7            2d6          1.5 Minutes
  8            3d6          1 Minute
  9            4d6          7 Rounds
  10           6d6          5 Rounds
  +1           +2d6         

If your blood loss is at least 25, your minimum fatigue level is
Fatigued. If it is above 50, your minimum fatigue level is Exhausted.
Each night of rest you receive decreases your total blood lost by the
result of a Health check.

### End of Combat

At the end of combat, when a character that gained at least one level of
fatigue in combat gets a chance to catch their breath and recover
(typically 2-10 minutes), they make a DC 10 Stamina or Grit check. This
can never result in reduction in your base fatigue level.

-   Critical Success: Lose two levels of combat fatigue and set your
    > base fatigue equal to this new value.

-   Success: Lose one level of combat fatigue and set your base fatigue
    > equal to this new value.

-   Failure: Set your base fatigue equal to your combat fatigue.

-   Critical Failure: Gain one level of combat fatigue and set your base
    > fatigue equal to this new value.

**Actions and Reactions** 
-------------------------

### Movement Actions

See the Facing section above for more details on attacks of opportunity
and facing during move actions.

-   Dash: You move up to your movement speed, facing forward for the
    > duration of the movement. You may Draw one readily accessible item
    > during your movement.

-   Guarded Move: You move up to half of your movement speed in any
    > direction. You may change your facing before each square of
    > movement.

-   Sprint: Make a DC 0 Sprint check. You move up to the sum of your
    > movement speed and your degree of success (rounded down to the
    > nearest 5-foot increment) in a straight line. You suffer
    > disadvantage on defensive maneuvers made in response to attacks of
    > opportunity provoked by your movement and all ranged attacks and
    > Aim attempts against you suffer disadvantage until the end of the
    > round. If you take this action multiple times in one round, you
    > use the Sprint check result of the first Sprint action.

-   Stunt Move: You move up to your movement speed facing forwards and
    > select an applicable Athletics skill or Tumble (or potentially an
    > alternative appropriate skill) to support the next action you take
    > this turn. The DC for the support check is 10 and always uses a
    > Mobility MUP. In many cases, this encourages players to engage in
    > unrealistic movement patterns or decisions to gain mechanical
    > advantage; this is intended as a means to make combat more
    > cinematic, creative, and dynamic. Repeated use of the same skill
    > (especially if it is your highest bonus), may result in increasing
    > DCs.

-   Reposition: You take a step and make a Positioning check, that may
    > be contested by any enemy that you threaten or threatens you.
    > Consider each opponent as a separate target for the purposes of
    > success and failure. You may use Reposition to attempt to enter
    > Close Combat by entering an opponent's square, although you suffer
    > disadvantage on the Positioning check. Your result supports an
    > offensive combat maneuver made during the following action in
    > addition to the results below.

    -   Critical Failure: As failure, but you provoke an attack of
        > opportunity from the target.

    -   Failure: Your movement does not provoke an attack of
        > opportunity, but the target may choose to Step as well
        > (including stepping away if you tried to enter Close Combat).
        > This Step does not provoke an attack of opportunity from you.

    -   Success: Your movement does not provoke an attack of
        > opportunity.

    -   Critical Success: As success.

-   Drive: You make a Positioning check, contested by the Positioning of
    > the target within reach.

    -   Critical Failure: You provoke an attack of opportunity from the
        > target.

    -   Failure: Nothing happens.

    -   Success: The target must either take a Step away from you (as
        > though Giving Ground, allowing you to follow them), or they
        > receive disadvantage on all contested physical checks against
        > you until the beginning of your next turn.

    -   Critical Success: As success, except that as you repeat the
        > process in 5-foot increments until they either choose to not
        > Step away or you have moved half of your movement speed
        > towards them. If they ever choose to not step away, the
        > disadvantage stacks for each 5-foot step worth of movement you
        > had remaining.

### Offensive Combat Maneuvers

#### Melee Attacks 

For all melee attacks, the Failure and Critical Failure results depend
on the target's defensive maneuver, and the effect of a Critical Success
is "As success, and you add your degree of success to your primary
weapon damage." For all melee attacks, you select a target wheel and
your angle of attack before rolling to hit. The roll button will also
automatically roll a hit location on that target wheel, then you report
the attack roll value and the hit location to the GM. For example,
"Barrister is going Strike at the bandit's Left Arm with his rapier. He
gets a ... \[rolls\] ... 16 to hit the bandit's left forearm."

-   Strike: You make a melee attack at a target wheel.

    -   Success: The attack hits the rolled location.

-   Attack Opening: You make a melee attack with double advantage at a
    > target and determine your target wheel as though making a ranged
    > attack.

    -   Success: The attack hits the rolled location.

-   Charge Attack: You make a melee attack with disadvantage at a target
    > wheel. You may only use the Charge Attack maneuver immediately
    > following an action in which you moved at least ten feet in a
    > straight line towards the target.

    -   Success: The attack hits the rolled location. Deal bonus damage
        > equal to the number of 5-foot increments that you had as
        > available movement when you started the straight line towards
        > the target during your previous action. For non-Light
        > Thrusting weapons, the bonus damage is doubled.

-   Gap Thrust (Finesse): You make a melee thrusting attack at a target
    > wheel, contested by the target's defensive maneuver. You suffer
    > disadvantage on this attack if using a Light weapon, double
    > disadvantage if using a One- or Two-Handed weapon, or triple
    > disadvantage if using an Oversized weapon.

    -   Success: The attack hits the specified location. You ignore AV
        > provided by Segmented and Damaged armor as well as any Overlay
        > armor on the target's Face, Neck, Shoulders, Elbows, Groin,
        > and Knees (or comparable hit locations on non-humanoid
        > targets)

-   Precise Strike (Finesse): This maneuver modified another offensive
    > combat maneuver that requires that you specify a target wheel. You
    > additionally specify an exact hit location on that wheel and may
    > choose to suffer any level of disadvantage on your swing. After
    > rolling but before the target reacts, for each level of
    > disadvantage you chose you move the rolled hit location one step
    > towards the specified hit location.

#### Other Melee Offensive Combat Maneuvers

-   Feint (Finesse): You declare a melee attack with advantage at a
    > target location, contested by the target's Combat Awareness or
    > Combat Analysis (in private if targeting a player). This roll is
    > made before the target chooses to take any defensive reactions.
    > After you roll, refund half of the MUP suffered by the attack
    > (rounded up)

    -   Critical Failure: You suffer disadvantage on all Feint attempts
        > against the target for the remainder of the encounter.

    -   Success: The target believes that it is a strike and takes
        > defensive combat maneuvers. On your next action, any defensive
        > maneuvers used to respond to your attack suffer disadvantage.

    -   Critical Success: The disadvantage lasts until the beginning of
        > your next turn instead.

-   Beat: You make a melee attack at a target weapon or shield,
    > contested by the target's Brawn or proficiency with that item.

    -   Critical Failure: On your next action, you suffer disadvantage
        > on any roll using the attacking weapon.

    -   Success: The target suffers disadvantage on any rolls using the
        > target weapon until the end of their next turn.

    -   Critical Success: The disadvantage lasts until the end of your
        > next turn instead.

> The targeted item may not be used to Block or Parry the Beat attempt.

-   Bind (Finesse): You make a melee attack at a target weapon or shield
    > with a weapon with the Binding quality, contested by the target's
    > Brawn or proficiency with that item. Attempts to resist or break a
    > bind with a one-handed weapon gain advantage while those with an
    > oversized weapon or large shield suffer disadvantage. You may not
    > bind a light weapon or buckler.

    -   Critical Failure: On your next action, you suffer disadvantage
        > on any roll using the attacking weapon.

    -   Success: Both the target weapon and the attacking weapon are
        > Bound and cannot be used for any action besides breaking the
        > bind or Disarm. You may drop a bound weapon without spending
        > an action. Neither character may move without dropping their
        > weapon while it is Bound.

    -   Critical Success: As success, and the target suffers
        > disadvantage on their next roll to unbind the target weapon.

> The targeted item may not be used to Block or Parry the Bind attempt.
> If your weapon is Bound, you may take the Bind action to attempt to
> unbind your weapon. If you succeed, neither weapon is Bound.

-   Disarm (Finesse): You make a melee attack at a target item held by
    > the target, contested by the target's Grip or proficiency with
    > that item. The target gains advantage if the target item is held
    > in more than one hand. You gain advantage if the target item is
    > Bound.

    -   Critical Failure: On your next action, you suffer disadvantage
        > on any roll using the attacking weapon.

    -   Success: The target suffers disadvantage on any rolls using the
        > target weapon until the start of their next turn.

    -   Critical Success: The target drops the item and it falls to the
        > ground in their square.

#### Ranged Attacks

You gain advantage if the target is within half of your weapon's range
increment, or suffer disadvantage for each multiple of your weapon's
range increment that the target's distance exceeds. You have less
control over the target wheel of a ranged attack. By default, you simply
set the Target dropdown to the general body shape of the creature (such
as "Humanoid") before you make a ranged attack.

-   Shoot: You make a ranged attack.

    -   Failure and Critical Failure: the attack hits the rolled
        > location.

    -   Critical Success: As success, and you add your degree of success
        > to your primary weapon damage.

There are two types of ranged attack modifiers. You may apply each one
up to three times on any given attack, and each iteration grants you one
level of disadvantage. For example, if you choose to suffer double
disadvantage on a Precise Shot, the attack hits a wheel up to two target
wheels in the direction of the initially specified wheel.

-   Precise Shot: After rolling, move the target wheel one step closer
    > to the specified target wheel (if possible).

-   Careful Shot: If the target wheel roll results in your shot hitting
    > any cover (including allies) instead of the target, you may add
    > two levels of disadvantage.

#### Brawling 

-   Grab: You make a Grapple check at a target wheel, contested by the
    > target's Brawn or Escape Artist. You gain advantage on this check
    > for each appendage used beyond the first.

    -   Critical Failure: You suffer disadvantage on Stability and
        > Balance checks until the beginning of your next turn.

    -   Success: The target is Grabbed. Roll 1d12 to determine the
        > Grabbed location.

    -   Critical Success: You gain advantage on your next offensive
        > combat maneuver against the target.

-   Interact: You state your intention to affect an opponent in close
    > combat or their items and make a Grapple or Thievery check,
    > contested by a skill of the target determined by the DM. Examples
    > of interactions would be trying to take off a helmet, take an item
    > from the target's belt, or flip up a visor. The DM may determine
    > that certain actions may require a critical success and/or
    > multiple successful checks to complete.

    -   Critical Failure: You suffer disadvantage on Grapple, Thievery,
        > and Grip checks until the beginning of your next turn.

    -   Success: The goal interaction occurs, unless the DM determined
        > it to be more complex.

    -   Critical Success: For complex interactions, the interaction
        > occurs. Otherwise, as success, and you gain advantage on your
        > next offensive combat maneuver against the target.

-   Tackle: You make a Bash check with advantage, contested by the
    > target's Stability or Balance.

    -   Critical Failure: You become prone.

    -   Success: Both you and the target become prone and enter Close
        > Combat.

    -   Critical Success: You gain advantage on your next offensive
        > combat maneuver against the target.

-   Shove: You make either a Bash check or an attack with your shield or
    > Hafted weapon, contested by the target's Stability or Balance.

    -   Critical Failure: You suffer disadvantage on Stability and
        > Balance checks until the beginning of your next turn.

    -   Success: The target is moved back 5 feet and you may take a step
        > towards them at no cost. This does not allow you to enter
        > Close Combat but does allow you to maintain Close Combat. If
        > the target is displaced into difficult or unsafe terrain, they
        > may be subject or entitled to additional checks (e.g. Balance
        > to avoid falling Prone in difficult terrain or Catch to grab
        > onto a ledge).

    -   Critical Success: You may push the target a number of feet up to
        > your degree of success (rounded down to the nearest 5-foot
        > increment). The target must make a Balance check or be knocked
        > Prone.

> If you shove with a shield, you may consider the result of the check
> as a Block check in response to any counterattacks by the target.

-   Trip (Finesse): You make a Trip check or an attack with a weapon
    > with the Tripping quality, contested by the target's Stability or
    > Balance check. You gain advantage if you Trip as an attack of
    > opportunity provoked by the target's movement.

    -   Critical Failure: You suffer disadvantage on Stability and
        > Balance checks until the beginning of your next turn.

    -   Success: The target is knocked prone.

    -   Critical Success: The target is knocked prone.

-   Throw: You make a Trip check with disadvantage, contested by the
    > target's Stability or Balance check. You gain advantage on this
    > check for each appendage used beyond the first.

    -   Critical Failure: You suffer disadvantage on Stability and
        > Balance checks until the beginning of your next turn.

    -   Success: The target is knocked prone in any adjacent square
        > within your reach.

    -   Critical Success: The target is knocked prone in any square
        > within your reach instead.

### Reactions 

Each actor in combat may use a reaction in response to a given action in
combat. Most reactions are either Counterattacks, Attacks of
Opportunity, or Defensive Combat Maneuvers. Talents may provide
additional reaction options. Each time a character takes a reaction,
their initiative score is reduced by one starting in the current round
if they have not already acted or in the following round if they have.

#### Defensive Combat Maneuvers

Defensive combat maneuvers do not have Failure/Critical Failure
conditions, as they are set by the Success/Critical Success of the
initiating action. A Critical Success on any defensive combat maneuver
results in the initiating action missing entirely. You may use any of
the options that may be applicable unless otherwise specified in the
attacking maneuver (e.g. you may Parry an attempt to Trip you with an
axe or Dodge a Disarm attempt). The reaction is resolved before any
contested checks occur (e.g. if you successfully Parry the axe, you do
not need to make a Stability or Balance check against the Trip).

You may use any number of defensive combat maneuvers to defend against a
given action, but the attack is always resolved immediately after a
Dodge (i.e., you may not attempt to Dodge and then attempt to Parry
afterwards). After you use a defensive combat maneuver (regardless of
the level of success), you are primed to continue defending that target
wheel. You gain advantage on defensive combat maneuvers to defend a
target wheel for each time you have used a defensive combat maneuver to
defend that wheel since the beginning of your last turn.

Defensive combat maneuvers against attacks from the rear (or flanks if
you are wearing a helm) or against unseen or unidentified enemies are
limited by Combat Awareness or Combat Reflexes, while those against
ranged attacks are similarly limited if you are threatened in combat.

-   Parry: You make a check with your weapon proficiency to contest a
    > melee attack. You suffer disadvantage for each weapon weight
    > category that the parrying weapon and the attacking weapon differ
    > beyond the first.[^1] You have advantage on the Parry if your
    > reach is longer than the attack's reach.

    -   Success: You take no damage but are subject to a Drop Disruption
        > with the parrying weapon with a DC equal to half of the
        > bludgeoning damage of the attack. Your Parry roll may be used
        > to defend the Drop Disruption, or you may roll a Grip check or
        > reroll your weapon proficiency (you must take the new result).

-   Block: You make a check with your shield proficiency to contest an
    > attack or ability.

    -   Success: The attacker hits your shield and rolls damage as
        > though they had Succeeded. You may choose whether damage that
        > exceeds your shield's soak value is dealt to the original hit
        > location or your hand/forearm (depending on the shield's
        > grip).

-   Dodge: You make a Dodge check to contest an attack or ability. You
    > gain advantage on Dodge checks against attacks that target your
    > appendages and disadvantage against attacks in close combat.

    -   Success: The attacker rolls damage as though they had Succeeded
        > but you may choose to either halve the damage, have the attack
        > hit an adjacent hit location, or have the attack hit an
        > adjacent target wheel. If redirecting the attack to a new
        > target wheel, reroll the precise hit location, if needed.

When using a defensive combat maneuver, you may use the following
modifiers.

-   Give Ground: If the attack was melee, you take a step away from the
    > attacker, gaining advantage on your reaction roll and the attacker
    > may step towards you at no cost. If the attack was ranged you may
    > move out of the area of effect of the attack (e.g. lateral
    > movement to dodge an arrow or moving out of the area of effect of
    > an explosion), gaining advantage on your reaction roll.

-   Close: You suffer disadvantage on your reaction roll against a melee
    > offensive combat maneuver.

    -   Success: You may take a step toward the attacker.

    -   Critical Success: This movement may be used to enter into Close
        > Combat if the attacker is within range.

-   Drop: You may become prone to gain advantage on your reaction roll
    > against an attack against your Head, Arms, or Upper Torso.

#### Counterattacks

When you are targeted by a melee attack, you may use your reaction to
make an offensive combat maneuver with disadvantage with a DC equal to
the initial attack roll. You may not make a counterattack if your
counterattack's reach is less than the reach of the attacking *weapon.*
If your counterattack's reach is less than the reach of the initiating
attack, you may only target the attacking target wheel. The
counterattack is resolved before the initiating attack.

-   Critical Failure: Your attack misses and you suffer disadvantage on
    > defensive combat maneuvers against the initiating action.

-   Failure: Your attack misses.

-   Success: You resolve the counterattack. If the attacking weapon is
    > used to Parry or the initial attacker attempts to Dodge an attack
    > at the attacking target wheel, the initial attack misses
    > automatically.

-   Critical Success: As success, and you gain advantage on defensive
    > combat maneuvers against the initiating action.

You may use a counterattack in conjunction with a defensive combat
maneuver (e.g. a Block or a Dodge), but you suffer disadvantage on all
defensive combat maneuvers. You may not counterattack in Close Combat.

#### Attacks of Opportunity

Sometimes opponents take actions that leave them particularly vulnerable
to attack, enabling you to use offensive combat maneuvers against them
outside of your turn without spending an action. An opponent provokes an
attack of opportunity if they take a physical action while you threaten
them but they do not threaten you. Creatures threaten any squares in
which they can make a melee attack without turning. Surrounded enemies
will often provoke many attacks of opportunity. One action may never
provoke more than one attack of opportunity. Common examples include:

-   Turning away from you

-   Moving away from you with their back turned (note than backing up
    > does not provoke an attack of opportunity unless you can target
    > them an additional square away)

-   Making an attack against a different target with their back turned
    > towards you

-   Casting a spell, retrieving a stowed item, or staunching bleeding
    > without threatening you

-   Moving towards you if you can target them a square away (for
    > example, if their reach is less than 5' while yours is greater
    > than 5' or if theirs is less than 10' while yours is greater than
    > 10').

When an opponent provokes an attack of opportunity while attempting to
move closer to you (by either attempting to enter close combat or moving
out of a threatened non-adjacent square), you may choose to suffer
disadvantage on the attack of opportunity to be able to Step away after
or instead of making the attack.

### Other actions

-   Reset: You make a DC 10 Combat Focus check. You decrease your MUP in
    > all categories by your degree of success.

-   Focused Reset: You make a DC 5 Combat Focus check. You decrease your
    > MUP in one category by your degree of success.

-   Defend: This action may only be taken as your first action on a
    > turn. Your defensive combat maneuvers are not limited by Combat
    > Awareness or Combat Reflexes and you gain advantage on all
    > defensive combat maneuvers and suffer disadvantage on all
    > offensive combat maneuvers until the beginning of your next turn.

-   Aim: You make a DC 10 Combat Focus, Combat Awareness, or Combat
    > Analysis check to aim at a specific target or square that you can
    > see.

    -   Critical Failure: You lose all benefits of previous Aim checks.

    -   Failure: You gain advantage on your next Aim check.

    -   Success: You gain advantage on your next attack against the
        > target or square.

    -   Critical Success: You gain double advantage instead.

> The benefits of Aiming can stack up to a maximum of triple advantage.
> You lose the benefits of Aiming if you take any other action or
> reaction. Some weapons (such as bows) have limits on the number of
> times you may take the Aim action before making an attack.

-   Lunge: Your base reach for your next offensive combat maneuver is
    > doubled. You suffer disadvantage on the combat maneuver if it is
    > not a Thrusting or Thrusting Blade attack.

-   Peek: You take a Step from one unthreatened square to another. After
    > completing a subsequent action this turn, you may Step back into
    > your original square without spending an additional action.

-   Take a Breather: This action may only be taken as your first action
    > on a turn. You lose all remaining actions this round. At the end
    > of the round, make a DC 15 Stamina, Morale, or Grit check. You
    > suffer disadvantage on the check if you are in a threatened square
    > and for each reaction you have taken in the round. You
    > automatically critically fail if you suffered a wound during the
    > round.

    -   Critical Failure: Nothing happens.

    -   Failure: You gain advantage on Take a Breather checks next
        > round.

    -   Success: You lose one level of combat fatigue.

    -   Critical Success: You lose two levels of combat fatigue.

> This action cannot return your combat fatigue to your base fatigue
> level.

-   Staunch Bleeding: Make a treatment check with a DC equal to the
    > damage of the wound you are attempting to staunch. You suffer
    > disadvantage on the check if you only use one hand. You also
    > suffer disadvantage on the check if you only use your hands rather
    > than some type of cloth or bandage (which typically requires
    > additional actions to take out or cut from existing clothing).

    -   Critical Success: The DOT multiplier is reduced to 0.

    -   Success: The DOT multiplier is reduced by 0.75.

    -   Failure: The DOT multiplier is reduced by 0.5.

    -   Critical Failure: The DOT multiplier is reduced by 0.25.

> After beginning to staunch bleeding, any adjacent character may choose
> to Apply Pressure as an action, increasing the check result by 2. This
> effect stacks up to once per round; each time the check result reaches
> a new level of success, the DOT multiplier decreases. If the check was
> made without a cloth or bandage, taking any action with the hand
> besides Apply Pressure instantly ends the benefit and returns the DOT
> multiplier to its starting value.

-   Apply Tourniquet: With an appropriate object in hand (such as a
    > tourniquet or a belt), you spend three actions applying the
    > tourniquet. Applying a tourniquet one-handed takes twice as long.
    > Select a hit location on the arms or legs of yourself or a willing
    > or unconscious adjacent creature and make a DC 10 Treatment check.

    -   Critical Success: The DOT multiplier for all wounds on the
        > selected limb farther from the heart than the location of the
        > tourniquet are reduced to 0.

    -   Success: The DOT multipliers are reduced by 0.75 instead.

    -   Failure: The DOT multipliers are reduced by 0.5 instead.

    -   Critical Failure: The DOT multipliers are reduced by 0.25
        > instead.

> After applying a tourniquet, any adjacent character may choose to
> Apply Pressure as an action, increasing the check result by 2. This
> effect stacks; each time the check result reaches a new level of
> success, the DOT multiplier decreases. While tourniquets are effective
> at reducing bleeding, they can result in permanent damage to the
> affected limb up to and including amputation.

-   Item interaction: You interact with a readily accessible item. This
    > could include drawing or stowing a weapon or wand, knocking an
    > arrow, drinking a potion, opening a door, or any other similar
    > activity. You may move up to half of your movement speed. Dropping
    > an item does not require an action.

-   Seize Initiative: Make an initiative check. If it is greater than
    > your current initiative, you move to that spot in the initiative
    > order in the following round.

-   Command/Inspire: You may make a Leadership or Inspiration check to
    > support your allies. You state a goal and each ally that can hear
    > you gains advantage on their next check to accomplish that goal.
    > For example, you could Inspire your allies to survive against the
    > ogre, providing advantage on their next defensive combat maneuver
    > against the ogre or Command them to bring it down or run away,
    > providing advantage on the next offensive combat maneuver or
    > Sprint check to move a way, respectively.

-   Delay: You may delay your action until a specific condition is met
    > before the beginning of your next turn. Once that condition is
    > met, you may take the specified action. All rolls made as part of
    > a Delayed action suffer disadvantage. If the condition was caused
    > by another creature's action or reaction, resolve that action or
    > reaction first. If you delay multiple actions, you may only
    > resolve one at a time; whatever creature\'s turn would typically
    > follow each of your conditions may always take an action between
    > your delayed actions.

-   Prepare: Any Delayed actions taken before the beginning of your next
    > turn gain advantage instead of suffering disadvantage. You gain
    > advantage on attacks of opportunity before the beginning of your
    > next turn.

Social Mode
===========

The social situation resolution system revolves around the social
hexflower, shown below. The GM secretly tracks the opinion that
important NPCs, groups, and organizations have of the players and
provides opportunities for players to use their skills to affect their
standing in the world. Players are able to affect their location on the
social hexflower for a given group or organization as a downtime
activity by taking social actions to flatter, impress, intimidate, or
insult their counterparts. and the NPC's opinion of the party will
inform the difficulty of attempting to deceive, provoke, convince,
threaten, make requests of, or bargain with them. Players can also take
social actions to ascertain an NPC's opinion of them, determine what
types of social actions the NPC is most amenable to, prevent their
relationship from decaying back towards neutral over time, and a variety
of others, detailed below.

![](media/image3.png){width="5.0in" height="4.739583333333333in"}

When an NPC's attitude needs to be randomly determined (such as their
variation from neutral when meeting the PCs for the first time), the DM
rolls a d12. On a 1--6, the NPC is Neutral. Each number from 7--12
corresponds to a hex adjacent to neutral, starting at the top and
proceeding clockwise. However, the party can change their "starting
point" for NPCs by both their actions (e.g. dealing with a town's zombie
problem would likely move the whole community one hex towards
Helpfulness) and by spending downtime on social activities. Specific
organizations and social classes can change their overall opinion of the
party or PC, and social interactions with members of those groups use
that hex as the starting point rather than Neutral. If an NPC is a
member of two groups with different opinions of the party, they use the
starting point of whatever group is more core to their identity or use
vector addition relative to Neutral at the DM's discretion.

### Affecting Attitudes

The most basic social action is an attempt to move the target's attitude
toward you. Each of the five movement actions is detailed below.

-   Flatter/Endear: You attempt to make the target more helpful by
    > flattering them or otherwise endearing them to you using either
    > Etiquette or Personability.

-   Inspire: You attempt to make the target more trusting by using
    > Inspiration. In certain situations, you may be able to use
    > Leadership or Divine instead.

-   Boast/Impress: You attempt to make the target respect you more using
    > an appropriate skill. Once you have stated your action and
    > selected a skill, the DM will determine if you gain advantage or
    > disadvantage based on the NPC and the skill chosen. For example, a
    > Daask enforcer may be more impressed by Brawn or Grip while a
    > politician might be more impressed by Etiquette or Khorvairian
    > History.

-   Intimidate: You attempt to make a target fear you more using
    > Intimidate or another threatening skills like brawn or a weapon
    > skill.

-   Insult: You attempt to move the target towards hostility by
    > insulting or otherwise belittling them using an Intimidate,
    > Comedy, or Wit check. This check may also operate with
    > disadvantage as a Flatter/Endear towards any other NPCs that have
    > a negative opinion of the target.

Third party NPCs with a positive or neutral attitude towards the target
of an Intimidate or Insult may move one hex towards contempt. All NPCs
will have baseline susceptibility to being flattered, inspired,
impressed, intimidated, insulted, deceived and provoked that serves as
the DC for other actions. The exact statement you make may grant
(dis)advantage or you may gain advantage from reasonable supporting
checks made by yourself or others. The results are as follows:

-   Critical Success: The target moves two steps towards the intended
    > direction.

-   Success: The target moves one step towards the intended direction.

-   Failure: The target does not move.

-   Critical Failure: The target moves one step towards contempt.

An attempt to change an NPC's opinion suffers disadvantage for both (a)
each time that social action has been attempted against that NPC and (b)
each previous attempt to change an opinion by that PC so far in the
social scene.

Some additional notes on the hexflower include:

-   If a player says something particularly offensive or inappropriate,
    > the target's opinion becomes Hostile or Dismissive without any
    > sort of roll.

-   Dismissive NPCs will try to end the conversation using reasonable
    > available means and is considered the failure state of social
    > interaction.

-   If an action would move a target's opinion off of the hexflower, it
    > instead moves the target to the adjacent hex. For example,
    > successfully Flattering a Gracious NPC would make them Helpful,
    > while Impressing them would make them Impressed.

-   Over time, relationships will decay back towards Neutral. Typically,
    > it takes one week to decay from the outer ring to the inner ring
    > and one month to one year to decay from the inner ring to neutral.

### Asks

Once you have the NPC's opinion where you want it (or simply have a
limited ability to move it further), there are four basic asks that you
can make of NPCs to gain value out of your relationship, detailed below.
Each type of ask has an associated skill, but in some cases it may be
possible to use an alternative skill at the DM's discretion. The base DC
for these checks is determined by the gravity of the ask and then
modified by the the NPC's attitude. Convincing an NPC of an outrageous
tale or getting them to agree to a lopsided bargain is far more
difficult than a modest request. The table below displays the
approximate DC based on the difficulty of the ask, which is determined
by the DM from the NPC's perspective.

  Ask Category   DC    Example Asks
  -------------- ----- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Basic          5     Threaten: Demand that an infirm, elderly goblin laborer give you directions under threats of violence.
  Reasonable     10    Bargain: Offer a fair price to a traveling merchant.
  Unreasonable   15    Convince: Assure a patron that the party has killed a particular Znir warlord with only his weapon as evidence.
  Difficult      20    Request: Asking a minor noble to fund an expensive expedition.
  Outlandish     25    Threaten: Bully a member of the King\'s Dark Lanterns into revealing sensitive international intrigue.
  Ludicrous      30    Convince: Persuade a bishop of the Silver Flame that the king of Karrnath is a vampire with little evidence.
  Impossible     35+   Request: Ask that Queen Aurala ir\'Wynarn abdicate her throne.

-   Convince: You make a Persuasion check to make the target believe
    > something you are saying. You may get (dis)advantage based on the
    > quality of your argumentation and the evidence that you provide.

    -   Critical Success: The target is thoroughly convinced and future
        > checks to Convince them otherwise have disadvantage.

    -   Success: The target is convinced but may have some reservations
        > or lingering suspicions.

    -   Failure: The target is not convinced, but may pretend to believe
        > you based on their personality.

    -   Critical Failure: As failure, and the target moves one step
        > towards contempt.

-   Request: You make a Persuasion or Personability check to get the NPC
    > to acquiesce to your request with nothing (or very little) in
    > return.

    -   Critical Success: The target agrees to the request. In some
        > cases, they may provide more than what was asked for.

    -   Success: The target agrees to the request but may have some
        > reservations.

    -   Failure: The target does not agree to the request, but may
        > either agree with caveats or only pretend to agree based on
        > their personality.

    -   Critical Failure: As failure, and the target moves one step
        > towards contempt.

-   Bargain: You make a Negotiation check to get the NPC to acquiesce to
    > your request in exchange for something in return. This can be
    > money, a favor, completion of a quest, or anything else that has
    > tangible value to the NPC. The DM will weigh both the request and
    > the offered 'payment' to determine the overall DC of the check,
    > meaning that it will be lower than simply making a request.

    -   Critical Success: The target agrees to the bargain. In some
        > cases, they may provide more than what you asked for.

    -   Success: The target agrees to the bargain but may take
        > additional precautions to ensure that your end is upheld.

    -   Failure: The target does not agree, but may either agree at a
        > higher price or only pretend to agree based on their
        > personality.

    -   Critical Failure: As failure, and the target moves one step
        > towards contempt.

-   Threaten/Demand: You make an Intimidate check to get the NPC to
    > acquiesce to your request in order to avoid explicit or implied
    > consequences. This can be a threat of violence, social
    > castigation, or anything else that the NPC may want to avoid. The
    > DM will weigh both the request and the threat to determine the
    > overall DC of the check, meaning that it will be lower than simply
    > making a request.

    -   Critical Success: The target is acquiesces to your demand. In
        > some cases, they may provide more than what you asked for.

    -   Success: The target is acquiesces to your demand.

    -   Failure: The target does not acquiesce, but may pretend to do so
        > depending on their personality.

    -   Critical Failure: As failure, and the target moves one step
        > towards contempt.

### Deception

Frequently, both PCs and NPCs have reason to lie to one another, which
is where the Deception skills come into play. The Act/Impersonate skill
is used as part of long-term attempts to pretend to be someone else; for
example, impersonating a customs inspector or pretending to be a devout
adherent of the Church of the Silver Flame. This roll can gain
(dis)advantage based on the quality of a disguise or your knowledge of
the target to be impersonated, but is typically made by the DM or only
rolled when it is tested by a Social Insight or Social Analysis check.
In contrast, Bluff is used as a precursor to a Convince, Bargain,
Threat, or Boast check in which you are lying, misrepresenting
something, or do not intend to follow through. The Bluff check is rolled
first versus the target's Detect Lies and the level of success is the
upper limit on the success of ensuing social rolls. For example, if you
Succeed on a Bluff check to Convince a noble that his brother-in-law is
a vampire, you could at best only Succeed on the Convince check; a
Critical Success would be impossible due to lingering doubts about the
validity of your statement.

NPCs also have occasion to be less than forthright or outright lie to
players. If a player asks how much they believe the NPC, notes their
suspicions, or engages in similar activities, the DM rolls a Detect Lies
check on their behalf. If the NPC is lying, the Detect Lies check is
compared to a DC set by the NPC's Bluff check with (dis)advantage
granted by the believability of the lie and supported by other Influence
checks like Persuasion or Intimidate, if relevant.

-   Critical Success: You are certain that the NPC is being dishonest.

-   Success: You are fairly certain that the NPC is being dishonest, but
    > not entirely sure.

-   Failure: You are fairly certain that the NPC is being honest, but
    > not entirely sure.

-   Critical Failure: You are certain that the NPC is being honest.

However, if the NPC is not lying, they make a Persuasion (or other
relevant skill) check against a DC based on the believability of the
truth using the Ask DC table. The NPC's degree of success is subtracted
from that DC to determine the DC of the Detect Lies check. For example,
a shopkeeper tells the party that the potion that they are buying
involves a rare ingredient found only on one particular mountain in the
Mror Holds, justifying its high price. The party is suspicious and a
player wants to determine how believable this is. The DM determines that
this is a somewhat unreasonable tale (even though it's true!) and sets
the DC at 15. The shopkeeper rolls a 13 on her Persuasion check,
resulting in a Detect Lies DC of 17.

-   Critical Success: You are certain that the NPC is being honest.

-   Success: You are fairly certain that the NPC is being honest, but
    > not entirely sure.

-   Failure: You are fairly certain that the NPC is being dishonest, but
    > not entirely sure.

-   Critical Failure: You are certain that the NPC is being dishonest.

In many cases where Bluff would be opposed by Detect Lies, an
Act/Impersonate check would instead be contested by Social Insight or
Social Analysis. Remember that all Deception checks are made based on
what the potential deceiver actually believes, not the truth.

Downtime Mode
=============

While the majority of game time will likely be spent doing combats,
skill challenges, and social scenes, your character will spend the
majority of their time in the world taking part in downtime activities.
Adventuring is a dangerous activity, but the time between adventures is
easily filled with training, recovery, carousing, resting, traveling,
schmoozing, and a whole variety of other activities that define who your
character is and where their place is in the world.

Downtime plays a key role in the growth of your character's abilities.
While completing quests and achieving milestones grants some proficiency
points and talents, the majority of your character advancement will come
from downtime activities. Most downtime activities require a skill
check. If the check exceeds 15 + 3 x your proficiency level, the roller
will turn green and you may gain a proficiency point in that skill. This
passive proficiency point eligibility only applies to the primary and
supporting rolls you take using downtime activity slots.

In downtime mode, time generally passes by the week, with each character
engaging in at least one downtime activity, selected from the table
below. Typically, a character can take two downtime activities at no
penalty. If you choose to take only one activity, you gain advantage on
the associated check. If you choose to take three or more downtime
activities, you suffer disadvantage on all activities for each beyond
the second. For example, you may take three downtime activities but
suffer disadvantage on all of them. Advantage and disadvantage from the
number of activities taken also applies to checking for skill point
gains.

  Activity            Goal                                                           Additional detail

### Lifestyle Level

#### Determining Lifestyle Level

When you operate in downtime mode, you must also select a lifestyle
level that determines your weekly expenditures as shown on the table
below. The table also includes Lodging and Food costs, which are two
large components of lifestyle costs. Covering these needs reduces your
overall lifestyle cost by the indicated amount. If your Food and Lodging
levels differ by exactly one, use the lower value. If they differ by two
or more, your overall level is one above the lower value if and only if
you also meet the minimum overall expenditure for that higher level.

For example, if you own and use Modest lodging for a week, you have
three options: 1) pay at least 1sp for Squalid food to maintain a Poor
lifestyle, 2) pay an additional 13sp (of which about 5sp would be food)
to maintain a Modest lifestyle, or 3) pay at least 30sp on food (a
Wealthy level) and an additional 28sp on other expenses (for a total of
70sp, including the 12sp from your lodging) to maintain a Comfortable
lifestyle. Purchases of other equipment or materials (such as a magic
weapon or a new tent) do not count towards lifestyle expenditure
minimums.

These prices are meant to be long-run average costs to reduce the need
for characters to track the price of a different inn every night. As
long as the average costs are paid, the exact living situation is up to
the characters. For example, traveling characters maintaining Squalid
lodging may be purchasing individual beds in a grungy bunkhouse, two or
three characters splitting a room at a pub with Poor lodging, paying a
farmer to sleep in her barn, or sleeping rough and occasionally paying
fines to local law enforcement. What matters is that the cost paid is
related to the in-game effects generated by the overall lifestyle level.
In all scenarios, the lodging cost of an additional character is reduced
by 50% if that person is a romantic partner or child. These housing and
food costs are for a typical large town, small city, or village along a
major trade route. More rural areas may have lower costs (about half)
and large urban centers like Sharn may have higher costs (about double),
as determined by the DM.

Characters may be interested in purchasing longer-term lodging, either
renting or purchasing. Typically, long-term rents (one or more year) can
be locked in at about half price. Buying lodging typically costs about
ten times the annual cost of the lodging, or 500 times the weekly cost.
E.g., Comfortable lodging costs 20sp per week; if a character wants to
purchase Comfortable housing for one person, it would cost approximately
100gp. It can be more efficient to purchase housing that can fit
multiple people. When buying or renting long-term, each additional
occupant capacity increases the price by 50% (additive). So, Comfortable
housing for two people (or, for example, a married couple and a child)
would cost approximately 225gp.

#### Effect of Lifestyle Level

Your character will be accustomed to a particular lifestyle. If you
operate at below your baseline lifestyle level, you gain one Stress per
week per level below your accustomed lifestyle. If you operate above
your accustomed level you lose one Stress per week per level above your
accustomed lifestyle instead.

Your lifestyle also affects your ability to effectively engage in
downtime activities. The modifier for all downtime activity rolls is
listed on the table below. Living at a lifestyle level above or below
Comfortable imparts one or more levels of advantage or disadvantage,
respectively, on all checks associated with downtime activities
(including supporting checks) with the exception of the Social and
Survival activities. The improved modifier for higher lifestyles can be
thought of as improved diet and rest, the ability to buy information or
gifts for others, the ability to hire higher quality aides, or whatever
else makes sense in the narrative. For simplicity's sake, almost all
costs that affect the success of downtime activities are built into the
lifestyle level, including paying for things like trainers, medical
care, or access to a library of wizards' scrolls. The primary exception
to this rule is the cost of medical care, detailed in the Rest activity.

For Social checks, your level of (dis) advantage instead depends on the
difference in lifestyle between yourself and the group to whom you are
making the social action. For example, if you are trying to ingratiate
yourself to the wealthy elite of the city, you may suffer disadvantage
if your lifestyle is Comfortable or below.

Finally, living at lifestyle levels below Comfortable grants a certain
percent chance per week per character that that character suffers a
Misfortune. The misfortune could be a wound, a disease, lost standing
for the party for a particular social group, lost/stolen items, trouble
with the law, or similar phenomena.

  Lifestyle      Lodging Cost   Food Cost   Total Cost   Misfortune   Modifier            
  -------------- -------------- ----------- ------------ ------------ ---------- -------- ---------------------
                 Daily          Weekly      Daily        Weekly       Weekly     Weekly

#### Lifestyle Level Descriptions

Wretched: You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home,
you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old
crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A
wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and
hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your
armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their
standards. You are beneath the notice of most people. Downtime
activities are not possible as you struggle to survive and the chance of
misfortune each week is 40%.

Squalid: You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside
town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You
have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often
violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and
misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few
legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered
some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or
suffer from disease.

Poor: A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a
stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and
unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably
unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a
flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some
legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime,
and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled
laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other
disreputable types.

Modest: A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that
you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town,
renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don't go hungry
or thirsty, and your living Conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary
people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families,
laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.

Comfortable: Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford
nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a
small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a
fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and
military officers.

Wealthy: Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury,
though you might not have achieved the social Status associated with the
old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to
that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty,
or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings,
usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at
a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.

Aristocratic: You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles
populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have
excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or
rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the
most Skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your
every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich
and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild
leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the
highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the
greater the chance you will be drawn into political Intrigue as a pawn
or participant.

### Downtime Activities

Rest

You try to heal up from a wound or disease with a combination of bed
rest and medical care. If you have any wounds, you make a Recovery check
and resolve it against the DC of each. If you have any other ailments,
you make a Health check and resolve it against the DC of each. These
checks may be supported by Treatment checks depending on the specific
malady, and certain herbs or medical products may apply advantage to or
affect the level of success of the check as well. Certain conditions,
such as infection, may inhibit the healing process.

-   Critical Success: Decrease the value of the wound by 2d3.

-   Success: Decrease the value of the wound by 1d3.

-   Failure: The wound value does not change.

-   Critical Failure: Increase the wound value by 1.

If you have a wound or disease and do not take the rest action, you are
treated as if you rolled a 0 on the Rest check. Once a wound reaches a
Current value of 0, it is removed from the sheet. Wounds with a Current
value of less than 10 do not impose any penalties, but may become
reaggravated and worsen in certain circumstances.

You may choose to pay for medical care. Comprehensive Jorasco-certified
medical care provides advantage on your Recovery and Health checks and
an additional level of success at the cost of the highest relevant DC
squared in copper pieces. So if you have a 15 damage wound or a disease
that requires a DC 15 Health check, it would cost 22ss 5 cc. Double this
cost if Surgery is required or similar complications are present. Note
that some communities may not have access to top-tier Jorasco-certified
medical care.

Self Care

The life of an adventurer can be stressful and downtime is your time to
unwind and deal with the mental trauma that you have endured. Your self
care activity may include whatever your character finds to be restful,
whether that is carousing at pubs, watching sporting events, spending
time at the beach, or any other similar activity. When you take the Self
Care action, you may either attempt to decrease your Stress level or
attempt to remove Hardened or Trauma notches.

If you choose to decrease your stress level, it decreases by 2d4. If you
take no other downtime activities, it decreases by 2d6 instead. You may
not reduce stress via the Self Care action if you take more than your
base number of downtime activities.

If you attempt to remove notches, select a Stress category and make a
Morale or Discipline with a DC equal to 15 or your current stress level,
whichever is higher.

-   Critical Failure: You gain one Trauma notch in the corresponding
    > stress track.

-   Failure: Nothing happens.

-   Success: You remove one Trauma notch in the corresponding stress
    > track.

-   Critical Success: You remove up two two Trauma notches from the
    > corresponding stress track.

You may choose to receive Therapy from a therapist or religious leader
that shares your religion during a Self Care action. If you do so, the
therapist makes a Therapy or Divine check with a DC equal to 10 + 2 x
your number of Hardened notches in a specified category. If they
succeed, you may choose to open yourself up to Therapy. If you do so,
remove the highest level Hardened notch and gain an additional level of
success on your Self Care action. The decision to open yourself up to
the Therapy is made before your roll.

You may instead choose to focus only on removing a hardened notch,
rather than processing your Trauma. If you do so you roll your Morale or
Discipline roll first and the result supports your therapist's Therapy
or Divine check.

Mercantile

You engage in some form of short-term economic activity with the goal of
making money. You may select an appropriate skill check with up to one
supporting skill. Based on the description of the activity and skills
chosen, the DM will determine additional situational sources of
advantage and disadvantage. For example, you may receive disadvantage if
the community is xenophobic towards your race or you may receive
advantage if you already have the raw materials required for production.
The Negotiation skill is used to model general business savvy and can
almost always be used as the primary or supporting skill. Beyond that,
you can be as creative as you would like. For example, you could use
Alchemy supported by Foraging to run an apothecary in a rural village or
you could use your two-handed blade skill supported by Persuasion to act
as a short-term mercenary for hire.

The base amount of money earned for a week of work is equal to the
square of your check result in copper pieces. This amount is multiplied
by the profit potential of your chosen activity, which is determined by
the DM based on your business plan and location. For example, if you
roll a 14 on your check in a high profit potential job, you earn 296cc,
or 29ss and 6cc. This is enough to maintain a Modest lifestyle and put
almost five sovereigns into savings.

  Profit Potential   Modifier
  ------------------ ----------
  Low                0.5
  Normal             1
  High               1.5
  Lucrative          2+

Certain (particularly high profit potential) mercantile activity may
also incur additional risks, such as responding to help wanted signs to
slay a local monster or criminal activity. In that case, the DM will
disclose a separate check required to determine potential harms, such as
a single DC 15 Dodge check to avoid injury or a DC 10 Hide or Bluff
check to avoid being jailed by local law enforcement.

Social

You can spend time changing you or the party's reputation with
particular social groups. As a downtime activity, you select a group and
a social action---either an attempt to change opinion or an ask---and
make the roll using the social rolls. You gain (dis)advantage based on
the size and accessibility of the group and access to certain groups may
require existing contacts or particular lifestyle levels. Typically,
groups start as neutral toward the PCs unless they have done something
to attract attention. When you change a group's opinion, whether that
applies to the character specifically or the party as a whole depends on
the player's description of their activities and the party's overall
brand in the eyes of that social group. Asks of a social group could
include Requesting information among the patrons of a seedy brothel,
Bargaining to source a particular magic item, Convincing the noble
elites of a city of an impending threat, or similar activities.

Crafting

There will be some crafting rules added later, and the Crafting skills
will be valuable for creating magic items as well, rather than just the
magical abilities. If anyone invests significantly into Crafting skills
I will obviously flesh out the subsystem sooner, but if no one is
interested in it then it will be a later project.

Alchemy

Select an adjacent hex and ingredient restrictions and make a Foraging
check against the resulting DC.

-   Critical failure: You find no ingredients

-   Failure: You find 1d3+1 ingredients

-   Success: You find 2d3+1 ingredients.

-   Critical Success: You find 3d3+1 ingredients.

Using those ingredients, you may attempt to make any number of potions,
poisons, and oils or conduct alchemical operations. Only the first
Alchemy check in a week is eligible for passive proficiency point gain.
Any ingredient not used as part of an Alchemy check expires at the end
of the week.

Research

You try to learn about something using a library or other source of
knowledge. You make a Research check supported by the most relevant
Knowledge or History skill. You may gain (dis)advantage depending on the
quality of the facility and the relevance to the topic of inquiry. The
DC is determined by the rarity of the information that you seek.

Training

You attempt to gain a talent or directly train a particular skill. If
you are only attempting to train a skill rather than gaining a talent,
make the check with advantage. Unless otherwise noted, you may not use
another skill to support a Training check.

If you are attempting to gain a Talent, make a skill check using any of
the skills that are a prerequisite for the Talent at the Talent's DC.

-   Critical Success: You gain the talent.

-   Success: You gain one success towards gaining the talent. If this is
    > your third success, you gain the talent.

-   Failure: You gain advantage on Training checks to gain the talent
    > the following week.

-   Critical Failure: Nothing happens.

You may also use the Research skill to gain a talent if it is something
that could reasonably be learned through reading and there is
appropriate reference material available. In general, you can use
Research to improve any For example, if you have access to a library,
using Research to gain the potion-making talent to learn new recipes
would be appropriate, as would studying combat treatises to learn the
Faircourt Gambit. However, it would be inappropriate to use Research to
gain a talent like Pack Mule. Grey area cases will likely suffer at
least one instance of disadvantage.

Live off the Land

You may wish to use your survival skills for subsistence rather than
paying for food or lodging. You make a Provision check to provide food
and lodging. If you attempt to only provide Food, you increase the
resulting lifestyle level by one whereas providing only Lodging grants
advantage on the roll.

-   Critical Success: You maintain a Modest level.

-   Success: You maintain a Poor level.

-   Failure: You maintain a Squalid level.

-   Critical Failure: You maintain a wretched level.

If you are attempting to provide for 2-3 people, reduce the lifestyle
level by one, and for 4-6 people, reduce it by two.

Train Animal

You may make a Creature Handling check to attempt to teach an animal a
trick. Each trick has a set DC and makes it so that you do not need to
make a Creature Handling check to instruct the animal to engage in a
particular action.

Language Learning

Select one language and make a Language Learning set equal to the Train
DC. The Train DC is 20 if you have no connection to the language, 18
with a weak connection, 16 with a moderate connection, and 14 with a
strong connection. The DC is reduced by 2 if it is an "Easy" language,
which are typically simpler or otherwise more intuitive languages.
Advancing your proficiency requires either an appropriate textbook or a
speaker of at least your level of proficiency. If you do not have access
to a speaker of the language with a proficiency level higher than your
own, you suffer disadvantage on the check. If you make this check while
immersed in the language (most commonly in a city where speakers of the
language are common), you gain advantage on the check.

-   Critical Success: You maintain a Modest level.

-   Success: You maintain a Poor level.

-   Failure: You maintain a Squalid level.

-   Critical Failure: You maintain a wretched level.

Traveling

Sometimes travel will be conducted in Downtime mode, particularly if you
are going at a reasonable pace on a well-traveled road. As long as you
are traveling approximately 8 hours at a fairly normal pace on a
relatively safe route, traveling is considered to be one Downtime
Activity. Traveling this way typically involves eating and sleeping in
inns or settlements, however you may use another downtime activity to
Live off the Land when traveling in more remote locations or on a
budget.

Travel Mode
===========

In travel mode, the party moves between 6-mile hexes that represent
different terrains. At the beginning of the day, the players each select
one Travel Action and pick a Pace (Cautious, Normal, Brisk, or Fast).
The Pace determines the maximum number of hexes that the characters may
travel and provides (dis)advantage on the travel action. From their
current hex, the party selects one adjacent hex to travel to and adds
that terrain to the travel tracker. Each terrain type adds a fixed
amount to the Endurance DC for the day, which is reduced if there is a
road or a particularly good path that the party is following.

                  Cautious    Normal   Brisk          Fast
  --------------- ----------- -------- -------------- ---------------------
  Travel Action   Advantage   --       Disadvantage   Triple Disadvantage
  Hexes/Day       2           3        4              6

### Travel Action

Travel Actions describe what the character is doing while traveling and
often allow that character to make a roll to avoid or affect travel
events. The standard Travel Actions are described below, but players may
always specify a different action/skill and describe what types of
hazards it may avoid or affect. At the end of the day, if a character's
Travel Action was not used, you may make a DC 15 check with the
corresponding skill to support the activities specified in the table
below. Making the participation check is entirely optional and the onus
is on the player to remember to do so!

  Action        Effect                                                              Participation Check to Support
  ------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------
  Navigate      Navigation check to avoid or mitigate effects of physical hazards   Party's Endurance
  Trudge        Discipline check to support own rolls for all hazards               Own camp activities
  Scout         Endurance to support Navigation or Lookout checks                   Own wilderness activities
  Lookout       Observation checks to notice other creatures or activity            Own wilderness activities
  Camaraderie   Speech, Instruments, or Inspiration to support Morale checks        Party's Leisure activities
  Drive         Leadership or Intimidation to support Discipline checks             Party's first hex activity that requires a roll
  Survey        Knowledge (Nature) to foresee or mitigate natural hazards           Own wilderness activities

### Food

Each day, each character must consume one food ration to stave off
hunger. Each food ration is one bulk for a Medium character or one light
item for a small sized character. For each day that you do not consume a
food, their hunger increases by one. If you have positive hunger, each
day of consuming at least one food ration decreases your hunger by one.
Each point of hunger results in a minus 2 penalty on Endurance checks.

### Hex Activities

Each day, each character may freely take two hex activities and may take
an additional hex activity if the party traverses only up to half
(rounded up) of the maximum hexes per day based on their pace. If the
characters do not travel, all characters may take four free hex
activities. Each additional hex activity results in disadvantage on that
character's Endurance check. Hex activities are divided into two groups:
Wilderness activities and Camp activities. Should an event occur during
a Hex Activity phase, this choice determines whether that character is
in the camp or not.

Unless otherwise noted, a Failure on a hex activity grants you advantage
on your next check of that type in that hex and on a Critical Failure
nothing happens.

#### Camp Activities

Rest: You gain advantage on your Endurance check.

Leisure: Make a Morale check with a DC equal to your current Stress
level (minimum DC 15). You gain advantage on this check if at least one
other party member takes the Leisure action at the same time. If you
succeed, lose one stress. You may only lose up to one stress per day in
this way.

Stand Watch: Make an Observation (Listen, Spot, or Scent) check to avoid
being surprised by hostile characters or creatures. This check result is
compared to the Move Silently or Hide checks (or Scent DC) of any
characters attempting to surprise you during this hex activity. A full
night of protected rest typically requires 4 total Stand Watch actions
which can be spent from the pool of hex activities from the day before
or after.

Cook: Make a DC 15 Cooking check to support the party's Endurance check.
You gain advantage on this check for each additional per-person ration
used (e.g. if you use 3 rations per person, you gain double advantage).

Set Up Campsite: Make a DC 15 Provision check to find the best campsite
for your needs. You may attempt to satisfy multiple conditions, but each
one beyond the first results in Disadvantage on your Provision check.
The result of the support check persist for as long as you remain at
this campsite.

-   Hidden Site: Your check result is the DC of Search attempts to find
    > you and confers some level of peace of mind when unguarded at
    > night.

    -   Success: Reduce the Stress due to unguarded sleeping by half.

    -   Critical Success: As success, and reduce the danger level by
        > one.

-   Comfortable Site: Supports Endurance check.

-   Relaxing Site: Support Leisure check.

-   Defensible Site: Supports Stand Watch actions and may provide other
    > in-combat benefits.

-   Lush Site: Supports checks to find food (Fish, Forage, Hunt Small
    > Game, Detect Quarry).

-   Protected Site: Mitigates or eliminates weather effects.

Craft: TBD; Probably only rules for making simple weapons and
projectiles.

Alchemical Operations: You may use an alchemical operation to purify and
preserve a substance prior to using it to Brew a Potion. A successful
operation changes all of the selected elemental essences in the
ingredient into the other essence presence in the ingredient and extends
the ingredient's time before expiration. An ingredient is eligible for
alchemical operation if and only if it has at least one elemental
essence and has no more than two unique essences. Make a DC 15 Alchemy
check

-   Critical Failure: The ingredient is destroyed.

-   Failure: The alchemical operation succeeds, but the Days until
    > expiration do not change.

-   Success: The operation succeeds; add 5 days until expiration.

-   Critical Success: As success, but add 10 days instead.

Brew Potion: Select a potion recipe that you know and ingredients whose
essences combine to cover all of the essences in the recipe. Make an
Alchemy check (DC 15 for Basic Potions or DC 20 for advanced potion)
with disadvantage for each ingredient used beyond your Alchemy
proficiency level (e.g. if you have level 2 Alchemy proficiency and are

Character Creation and Advancement
==================================

Character Creation
------------------

### Character Creation Heuristics

Like other aspects of the game, the character creation process is much
more involved and granular in 2d10 than in many other TTRPGs. The goal
of the backgrounds is to describe a character's entire life arc before
the beginning of the campaign, not just to describe one or two primary
capabilities. The system is entirely classless and highly customizable;
your backgrounds set your starting point but your character's
capabilities and abilities will grow in response to the campaign and
your decisions over time. Below is an overview of each attribute and
some key considerations when deciding whether to accept a given
attribute distribution.

**Strength** measures physical power and raw muscle force, affecting a
character\'s ability to lift, carry, and engage in combat. Your strength
score will directly affect how encumbered you are, which can result in
penalties to physical skills as well as becoming fatigued faster in
combat, especially while wearing armor. Strength is most important in
melee combat, where it affects your probability of hitting, your damage,
how quickly you become fatigued, and how much armor you can reasonably
wear. High strength characters are likely to gravitate towards larger
weapons, heavier armors, and bows or thrown weapons, while low strength
combatants should lean into lighter weapons, shields or off hand
weapons, magic, and crossbows.

**Dexterity** reflects a character\'s fine motor skills and
coordination, impacting tasks like aiming an attack, sleight of hand,
and crafting. Dexterity affects your probability of success on most
combat activities, including melee attacks, ranged attacks, spell
attacks, parrying, and blocking. Low dexterity characters may find
success in relying more heavily on their Strength or Agility in combat,
finding sources of advantage for their attacks, engaging in utility
actions like supporting others, and casting spells that do not require
aim. Out of combat, your fine motor skills impact your ability to craft
or repair items and manipulate mechanical devices, like locks, traps,
and other gadgets.

**Agility** represents overall speed and nimbleness, influencing a
character\'s ability to dodge attacks, move carefully, and react
quickly. Agility is a key skill in melee combat, affecting both your
Dodge and Positioning skills. High agility characters are able to rely
on their elusiveness to wear less armor, forgo a shield, move around the
battlefield, or simply double down on defensiveness (not a bad idea in a
game where wounds can be brutal!). Low agility characters should find
alternative defensive capabilities and be more careful about their
position on the battlefield. Agility also affects you ability to move
silently, ride, sprint, and engaged in acrobatic activity.

**Constitution** gauges a character\'s physical endurance and
resilience, affecting their health, resistance to disease, and ability
to recover from wounds. When in travel mode, all characters roll an
Endurance check each day that can affect their fatigue, meaning that low
Constitution characters may find themselves needing to pack a lighter
bag, take more rest actions while traveling, or simply be more tired
upon arrival. In combat, a characters' resistance to fatigue can be
determined by Constitution, Willpower, or Heart, so your highest
attribute among the three is an important consideration in your ability
to take a hit and exert yourself.

**Perception** measures awareness and attentiveness, influencing a
character\'s ability to notice details, detect hidden threats, and
navigate through their surroundings. Perception affects your awareness
in combat and in social situations as well as your ability to see, hear,
and smell more generally. It is also the primary determinant of your
survival capability and governs your ability to use vehicles (including
boats).

**Willpower** represents mental fortitude and determination, affecting a
character\'s resistance to mental attacks, magical power, and
perseverance in the face of adversity. When faced with a potentially
frightening or traumatic event, a character will need to rely on their
Willpower or Heart to make it through unscathed, so having at least one
of those attributes be positive is an important consideration. Willpower
is particularly important for spellcasters, as it is the default
attribute for all magical skills, as well as your ability to concentrate
on spell effects over time. However, many casting traditions allow you
to replace Willpower with another attribute for particular spheres (e.g.
Intelligence for Wizardry and Heart for Willpower can also be a valuable
boon for more mundane combatants, reflecting your ability to resist
stressors, avoid fatigue, and remain focused in combat.

**Heart** symbolizes courage, morale, and emotional strength, impacting
a character\'s resilience against fear, ability to inspire others, and
overall passion of spirit. Of all of the attributes, Heart is the most
skippable; every roll that involves Heart can be accomplished via
another statistic instead. However, a character with a high Heart can
apply that emotional vigor to a broad swath of situations, so it is
highly efficient to have a Heart-based build. Heart is also used for
many religious effects, including all divine spellcasting traditions.

**Influence** measures a character\'s social charisma and persuasive
abilities, affecting their success in diplomacy, intimidation, and
leadership. Influence governs a wide array of social capabilities, both
in any out of combat. In combat, it is important for intimidating foes,
commanding allies, and controlling creatures. Your character's ability
to effectively engage in social activities will always be important; the
social rules result in repeated attempts by the same character to suffer
increasing levels of disadvantage, so having one character in the party
with no social skills at all can become a real liability.

**Intelligence** reflects cognitive abilities, problem-solving skills,
and knowledge, influencing a character\'s medical skills, understanding
of complex information and success in various intellectual pursuits.
Intelligence is in many cases the second most skippable attribute for an
individual character. However, a party full of idiots will likely not
make it very far in life. In addition to granting a character increased
understanding of History and Knowledge that may be very relevant in
life-or-death situations, medical skills are highly valued in situations
where it might not be possible to return to a settlement for care.
Intelligence also provides more general skills like language capability
and the ability to properly analyze both combat and social situations.

After assigning attributes, there are approximately 200 skills in which
you will track your character's proficiency. However, not all skills are
created equally; your character's Dodge skill is likely more important
to their adventuring career than their Brewing skill (though not
always!). Below are skills that are either particularly important or are
paired up with other skills as being frequent substitutes for one
another; for example, in most cases that you are asked to make a Balance
check, you can make a Stability check instead.

-   Brawn: Reduces encumbrance penalties and fatigue cost of physical
    > actions.

-   Grip & Catch: Both used to avoiding falling off of ledges and
    > similar, although they have other individual uses as well (such as
    > Grip being used to avoid being disarmed if it is higher than your
    > weapon proficiency)

-   Stability & Balance: Both used to avoid being knocked over, although
    > Stability can also help avoid being pushed backwards while Balance
    > can be used to walk along thin ledges.

-   Instruments (any), Dance, Sing: In many cases, these skills are used
    > as substitutes for one another, often in conjunction with the
    > Performance skill. However, each has different talents and
    > potentially casting traditions associated with it.

-   Positioning: Used to safely move around the battlefield, force your
    > opponents to move where you want them, and gain advantage in
    > combat by shifting to a better location.

-   Combat Reflexes and Combat Awareness: Either of these skills may be
    > used to roll initiative at the start of combat as well as to try
    > to react to attacks from behind you or to ranged attacks while you
    > are engaged in melee combat.

-   Dodge: Used to take the Dodge reaction in combat.

-   Endurance: Used to determine fatigue gain from traveling.

-   Stamina, Grit, and Morale: You select one of these to be rolled at
    > the beginning of every single round of combat to determine your
    > fatigue level. Having one of these be relatively high (or at least
    > non-negative) is very valuable for any combatant.

-   Social Awareness skills (Detect Lies, Etiquette, Social Insight) and
    > Social Analysis: Social Analysis can often be used as a substitute
    > for any of the Social Awareness skills, but with additional
    > limitations such as requiring a longer observation period or
    > suffering disadvantage.

-   Combat Focus: Used to reduce multi-use penalties (MUPs) in combat.

-   Concentration: Used to maintain concentration on any applicable
    > spells.

-   Discipline, Courage and Morale: Discipline can be used to resist
    > stressors as well as to process trauma later on. Courage and
    > Morale can be used to resist different subsets of stressors, and
    > Morale is used to process the trauma later on.

-   Inspiration and Leadership: Either one can typically be used to
    > command allies effectively, though Inspiration can have individual
    > social uses as well.

-   Combat Analysis: The one directly combat-related intelligence skill,
    > Combat Analysis can be used to give yourself or allies advantage
    > in combat.

### Attribute Roller

The use of the character creation tool is highly recommended when
creating a new character. On the Attribute Roller tab, select a Race and
then click the Roll Stats button. Each stat has an initially generated
value of 2d3-1d6+racial modifiers. Because these raw rolls could result
in wildly unbalanced characters, the sheet then takes the non-racially
modified rolls and randomly assigns stat increases and decreases until
the raw rolls for the nine stats sum to -1, 4, or 9 (whichever is
closest to the original sum). That sum corresponds to the number of
Background Points available during the next step of the character
creation process; with 7, 6, and 5 Background Points, respectively.
Characters with lower stats will likely be stronger (or more
well-rounded) early on in the campaign, while those with higher stats
will scale to be stronger later once they catch up in terms of
proficiency points and talents. You can also select for your character
to be particularly wealthy (regardless of background) at the cost of one
Background Point. This will provide significant additional starting and
ongoing funds, but may not be appropriate for all campaigns.

Some races have a floating point. If your selected race has one, use the
checkboxes in column D to assign the floating point to an attribute of
your choice. However, floating points may never be assigned to your
highest attribute (even if it is tied for the highest). You may click
the Reroll Stats button and change your race as many times as you wish ;
however, previous rolls will not be saved and you should exercise
reasonable restraint as the spirit of the attribute generation system is
to create relatively random attribute distributions. You may change your
Gender, Age and Origin freely after rolling for stats. Gender only
affects height/weight and origin only affects comfortable temperature
range and determines your automatic Origin background.

### Backgrounds

Once you have settled on a race and attribute array, you will proceed to
the Backgrounds tab. Here, you will select backgrounds in row 3 until
you have spent all of your Background Points (BPs). You may use the
Filter in row 2 in order to look only for Origin, Religion,
Professional, or combat Backgrounds. Each background has a BP Cost of 1,
2 or 3, which also corresponds to the number of proficiency points
available to spend on its associated skills.

  BP Cost   Proficiency Points   Talents
  --------- -------------------- ---------
  1         12                   2
  2         25                   4
  3         40                   6

All characters have an origin, which automatically occupies one
Background Point. Each background has associated skills and a cap of 1,
2, or 3 for each. This cap is the maximum number of proficiency points
that you may allocate to that skill from that background. If a
background has no cap for a particular skill, you cannot assign
proficiency points from that background to that skill. You also have a
pool of 15 Floating Skill Points that may be allocated to any skills
using the checkboxes in column G; only one Floating Skill Point may be
assigned to each skill.

Your proficiency in all non-Sphere skills is automatically Linked with
similar skills. Whenever you achieve a new proficiency bonus (minimum
+4) in any skill, all Linked skills with fewer proficiency points gain a
proficiency point for free. Basic skills are Linked with all other
skills in their Skill Group, sphere skills have no initial Links, Ranged
Weapon and Shield skills are linked with the skills that are immediately
above and below them, and Melee Weapon and Natural Attack skills are
Linked with all skills that are immediately above, below, left, or right
of them on the grid. The sheet will automatically calculate up to 19
skill point cascades from linked skills. Your total proficiency points
in each skill is the sum of the points from backgrounds, Floating Skill
Points, and points from Linked skills.

In some cases, you may assign a skill point and the total does not
increase because you have two or more Linked skills that have the same
total with at least three proficiency points. In this case, the sheet
does not know to which skill to assign the extra Linked skill point and
the Eq Pts (Equality Points) entries in column F will turn green. In
this case, add Eq Pts in the green cell of your choosing until they
return to their initial blue color.

Continue with character creation until you have spent all Background
Points, spent all Floating Skill Points, and resolved all Equality
Points. Column I provides your skill bonus for each roll based on your
total proficiency points, attributes, and racial skill modifiers.

### Background Talents

For each background you select, you will be able to select a number of
talents equal to twice

the Background Point cost. These talents are selected on the Background
Talents tab from a limited pool, indicated by the checkmarks on the
right side of the table. You can filter the table for each background by
setting the filter to only show "TRUE" entries for a given column. A
given talent can be selected by the background if the background has a
proficiency point cap of 2 or 3 for any of the skills that the talent
has as a prerequisite. A checkmark [does not]{.ul} mean that you meet
the prerequisites, only that it can be selected using one of your
background talent slots.

Skill-based prerequisites are based on your proficiency bonus (PB) in
the indicated skill. For example, if a talent has a prerequisite of
Dodge 4, it means that you need at least three proficiency points in
Dodge, resulting in a Dodge PB of +4.

Select a talent for each blue cell at the top of the sheet. Rows 9 and
10 are hidden by default because there are few 3 BP backgrounds that
would necessitate a 5th and 6th talent. If you have selected a 3BP
background, ensure that you unhide those rows and select all the talents
that you are owed.

### Traits & Free Talents

Traits offer a wide array of character options, from physical traits to
financial obligations or benefits to vows that you have taken. The
traits that you take also affect the number of Free Talents that you may
select at the end of character creation. This is represented in the Cost
in column E. Traits with positive numbers cost that number of Talents,
while traits with negative numbers give you that number of additional
Talents, which are added to a base of two Free Talents. You may select
up to five traits using the checkboxes in column B.

Once you have selected all of your desired traits, you proceed to the
Free Talents tab to select the indicated number of talents using the
checkboxes in column L. As always, you must meet the prerequisites for
the talents, but there are no other limitations on which talents you may
select.

### Pasting to Character Sheet

At this point, you are done with the Character Creation Tool. Now you
will copy and paste [as values]{.ul} four arrays from the Character
Creation Tool into your character's Stat tab in the character sheet
spreadsheet.

1.  Go to the Attribute Roller tab. Copy Y2:Y14 and paste [as
    > values]{.ul} in cell T11 on your Stat tab.

2.  On the Attribute Roller tab, copy AA3:AA11 and paste [as
    > values]{.ul} in cell X11 on your Stat tab.

3.  On the Backgrounds tab, copy H11:H235 by selecting cell H11 and
    > hitting ctrl + shift + down arrow. Paste [as values]{.ul} in
    > *both* cells C11 and M11 on your Stat tab.

4.  Hide columns B:D of your Stat tab.

5.  Go to the Export tab of the Character creation tool. Copy all of the
    > entries in the table and paste [as values]{.ul} in cell S26 of
    > your Stat tab.

### Outfitting and Stress

There are only a few steps remaining in the character creation process.

1.  In the character sheet spreadsheet, go to the Stress tab and
    > distribute 6 hardened notches between the four stress meters. You
    > may not place more than half of your available hardened notches in
    > any one category. If you want more Hardened notches, they are
    > available as Traits.

2.  All characters start with a wealth of 200ss. Traits may increase or
    > decrease this number.

    a.  Armor prices and sample sets can be found on the Armor pricing
        > tab of the character sheet, where you can also see the
        > protection provided as well as other characteristics of an
        > armor set. Armor sets can be copy+pasted as values from the
        > sample armor sets into the armor pricing tool and from the
        > armor pricing tool onto your sheet. You have slots for three
        > active armor sets that can be toggled on your combat sheet.
        > Often, some split like Town, Traveling, and Combat or similar
        > are employed.

    b.  Weapon prices are found on the Weapons tab, along with each
        > weapons statistics.

    c.  Ammunition prices are available in the Ammo and Materials tab.
        > You can make additional ammunition options in the table on the
        > left of the tab, and then make sure you put in the exact same
        > name in the Ammunition section on your combat sheet.

    d.  Other starting adventuring items can be found on the Equipment
        > tab of the character creation tool. Rather than tracking every
        > particular item, most items can be best thought of as being a
        > component of a particular kit (e.g. pitons in the climber's
        > kit, bandages in the healer's kit) or as part of a set of
        > Supplies. Supplies can have a theme and you can spend any
        > amount of money and bulk on them, noted on your character
        > sheet. Then, if you need a particular item, roll a Planning
        > check to see if it is present in your supplies.

3.  Select a character name, rename tabs, pick a color, and update
    > character name/color throughout the character sheet.

Economy
=======

Merchants and nobles use letters of credit to handle large transactions,
drawing on the reserves of the banks of House Kundarak. But most
day-to-day transactions use coins of precious metal. With the collapse
of the kingdom of Galifar, each of the Five Nations began to mint its
own currency, though each still works with House Kundarak to use the
same metals, weights, and denominations set forth in the days of
Galifar, maintaining a simple standard for commerce across Khorvaire.
The value of a coin is closely tied to the value of its base metal,
although House Kundarak works to keep the coins slightly overvalued to
discourage smelting them down.

As supply and demand for the metals changes, House Kundarak actively
replaces the coins in circulation to better align with their new values.
For example, after the Silver Crusade ended, the demand and therefore
price of silver decreased, resulting in thicker sovereigns. In the past,
each dragon was worth ten galifars rather than five, only decreasing
once House Kundarak could no longer make the coins heavier to account
for increased platinum production from the mines of the Blackcaps.

The smallest of the common currencies, the copper crown (cp)
traditionally depicts the crown of Galifar on one face. The crown is the
lowest denomination of coin minted under the rule of Galifar, which
spawned the saying, \"In Galifar, even the beggars have crowns.\" The
silver sovereign (sp) bears the face of a living or recent ruler
depending on the nation in which the coin was minted. Each sovereign is
worth ten crowns and an unskilled laborer outside of a major city can
expect to earn a sovereign for a day\'s work. The gold galifar (gp)
bears the image of Galifar I, the founder of the old kingdom and is
worth one hundred sovereigns. The platinum dragon (pp) bears the image
of one of the dragons of legend. With a value of five galifars or five
hundred sovereigns, these coins are used only by the wealthiest citizens
of Khorvaire, and the average peasant might never see such a coin.

A number of other coins remain in circulation, such as the double crown
of Breland (2 cp) and the silver throne of Cyre (5 sp); these
nonstandard coins were the result of precious metal limitations for
individual nations during the last war, begrudgingly approved by House
Kundarak. However, all the major nations of Khorvaire make use of the
four basic coins described above. For the lower classes, in some cases a
single crown is too large a denomination and they divide the legal
tender into smaller pieces. These are commonly referred to as a
two-crown (half a crown, pronounced 'tuckrin') or a four-crown (a
quarter crown, pronounced 'forkrin').

While a comparison to a modern, real-world economy is crude at best, it
may be helpful to consider that a crown, sovereign, galifar and dragon
roughly equate to \$5, \$50, \$5,000, and \$25,000 to put prices into
perspective.

Equipment
=========

Encumbrance and Inventory
-------------------------

Bulk is a combined measurement of weight and unwieldiness. Objects are
either negligible ( ), light (L), or measured in Bulk. Bulk doesn't have
decimal values. Negligible Items aren't worth counting, and don't count
against your weight unless you try to transport them in large enough
numbers that the GM deems they should have a Bulk. Examples include
sticks of chalk, loose paper, and other objects less than a few ounces.

Light Items are small and typically less than a few pounds. Light
weapons, potions, and scroll tubes are all example light items. Every 3
light items equal 1 Bulk. An object of 1 Bulk is typically around 5 lbs
if it is packable or a couple of pounds but somewhat annoying to pack or
carry. One- and two-handed (medium-sized) weapons are considered 1 Bulk
while oversized weapons are considered 2. Every 500 coins (of any type)
is considered to be one Bulk, rounded down.

Inventory is divided into three segments: readily available, backpack,
and other. Readily available equipment consists of items that are on
your person and can be accessed with a single action, such as a sword in
a scabbard, a strung bow on your back, a potion on a bandelier, or a
wand on your belt. Such items contribute their full bulk to your Total
Effective Carried Bulk.

Items carried in your backpack are harder to access (taking a number of
actions to retrieve based on your backpack selection), but confer
several benefits. First, it allows you to carry more items than you
could reasonably carried in your hands, pouches, and belts. Second, each
backpack has a Bulk multiplier that decreases the contribution of items
in your backpack to your Total Effective Carried Bulk. Finally,
backpacks can be dropped (typically one action), which allows you to
lower your encumbrance temporarily until you retrieve your pack.

Finally, the Other category is a list that allows you to list
possessions not on your person, such as those left in bases, inns, or
House Kundarak vaults, as well as intangible assets or liabilities such
as land or debt.

Carrying a significant number of items weighs you down. Your Total
Effective Carried Bulk may result in penalties to physical actions and
is calculated as the sum of the bulk of readily accessible objects and
the bulk of backpack items adjusted by the backpack's bulk multiplier
all adjusted by your Brawn factor (1+Brawn mod/10) and rounded down.
Every four points of Total Effective Carried Bulk results in a -1
penalty to Mobility checks and every 10 points results in a -1 penalty
to Left and Right hand checks.

Weapon Abilities
----------------

In addition to variation in damage, skill required, and size, all
weapons have at least one special tag that provides an additional
feature or drawback. Each ability is summarized in the table below.

  Simple        Advantage on Melee Attacks
  ------------- -----------------------------
  Balanced      Advantage on Parries
  Unbalanced    Disadvantage on Parries
  Binding       Advantage on Bind attempts
  Hafted        Advantage on Shove attempts
  Polearm       Enables Haft weapon option
  Lance         Enables Lance weapon option
  Penetrating   Penetrates Maille armor
  Slicing       Penetrates Organic armor
  Sundering     Penetrates Plate Armor

Armor
-----

Armor is very valuable for providing Armor Value (AV) to particular hit
locations. However, Armor does present drawbacks in terms of increased
penalties to your Mobility, Left, or Right (depending on the hit
location covered) as well as increased fatigue costs for certain actions
related to those penalties. Armor and Clothing also affect the minimum
and maximum heat levels that you can tolerate while traveling

Stress
======

### Trauma Tests

There are four categories of mental stress: Violence, the Unnatural,
Helplessness, and Self. It's quite possible to be very casual about,
say, Violence, while being totally unhinged when it comes to the
Unnatural. Each stress meter has two types of notches you can mark off.
The ten Hardened notches represent stress checks you've beaten while the
five Trauma notches represent stress checks you've failed. Different
stresses have different levels that vary from one to ten. The higher the
level of the stressor, the more extreme the stress.

If you already have a hardened notch at the same rank as the stressor in
the same meter, you don't have to roll when you face a trauma test of
that level. You automatically beat the check because you've faced this
down before and prevailed. Trauma notches don't affect stress tests. If
you do not have the requisite hardened notch, make a Discipline (any
stressor), Morale (Violence or the Unnatural), or Courage (Helplessness
or Self) check with a DC of 15 or your current Stress level, whichever
is higher. You suffer disadvantage for each missing hardened notch
between you and the level of the stressor).

-   Critical Failure: You mark off the next two Trauma notches for that
    > meter and you Panic. If you critically fail due to suffering four
    > or more instances of disadvantage on your roll, you mark off an
    > additional Trauma notch for each level of disadvantage beyond the
    > third.

-   Failure: You mark off the next Trauma notch for that meter and you
    > Panic.

-   Success: Mark off the next Hardened notch for that meter.

-   Critical Success: Mark off up to the next Hardened two notches for
    > that meter, not exceeding the DC of the check.

For example, Barrister, Guy and Vic are fighting in a tavern when
Barrister suffers a serious wound, resulting in a level 3 Violence test
for the whole party. Guy, a veteran of the Last War, has five hardened
notches in Violence and does not need to roll. Barrister has only two
notches and must roll against a DC of 19, his current stress level.
Because there are no notches between Barrister's second hardened notch
and the test's required third notch, he does not suffer disadvantage. In
contrast, Vic has only one hardened notch in the Violence stress meter
and currently has 8 stress. He makes a DC 15 Courage or Discipline check
with disadvantage due to the missing second notch between his hardened
level and the test's level.

Vic rolls a 17 and gains a second hardened notch in the Violence stress
meter. Barrister rolls a 12, gaining one trauma notch and panics.
Barrister's player, seeing that he is seriously injured and may soon
need medical attention but that Guy and Vic should be able to win the
fight, elects to Freeze and only take defensive actions for the
remainder of the combat.

It's common to have both Hardened and Trauma notches in the same meter.
Someone who's deep in both directions on the Violence meter likely feels
little or nothing when exposed to most forms of bloodshed, but when
something is so shocking that it gets through the hardened barrier, the
result is devastating.

### Panic

Whenever you fail a trauma test, your character Panics. All characters
handle stress differently and can respond to different stressors in
different ways. When a character Panics, the player must choose one of
Fight, Flight, or Freeze which defines that character's mindset for the
remainder of the scene. Whether the character is already in combat or
not affects how these choices are manifested, as explained below.

-   Fight

    -   In combat: You do everything that you can to effectively fight

### Trauma

Each time you reach five Trauma notches on a meter, the psychological
effects of your Trauma become permanent. Your character gains a
permanent disorder that will likely affect and inhibit them for the
remainder of their career. Examples include phobias, shakiness, anxiety
disorders, and substance addictions. Additionally, while you have five
Trauma notches in a meter, you automatically fail all checks responding
to stressors from that meter to which you are not hardened.

### Getting Callous

When you've seen enough horror, it loses its power to horrify you. The
more hardened notches you have on a single meter, the more it takes for
that kind of stress to affect you. Once you resist ten incidents on a
meter---that is, all ten hardened notches on that gauge are filled
in---you're so jaded and blasé about it that nothing in that category of
stress can endanger your mind. That is, generally speaking, not a good
thing.

Mental stress makes us vulnerable. But it also makes us mortals. If you
fill in too many hardened marks, you become so completely callous that
you are unable to feel fear at all. That's because you are now cut off
from a broad range of emotional experiences that everyone else shares.
You're hardened into an emotional fortress, completely isolated, unable
to make a fundamental connection with other human beings or your own
passions and hopes.

-   You become a sociopath when you have all ten hardened marks in a
    > single stress meter or when your total sum of hardened marks
    > exceeds twenty-five.

-   You automatically critically fail all checks involving your Heart
    > attribute and cannot use Fate Points.

-   Both your and your therapist's rolls to remove notches (both
    > Hardened and Trauma) suffer disadvantage.
