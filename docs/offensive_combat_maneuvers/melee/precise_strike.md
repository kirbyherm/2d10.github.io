# Precise Strike

Precise Strike is a modifier for melee attacks that target a hit location. You suffer disadvantage and specify a hit location on the target wheel.
* Failure and Critical Failure: As the modified maneuver.
* Success: As the modified maneuver, but if the rolled hit location is adjacent to the specified hit location, you hit the specified location instead.
* Critical Success: As the modified maneuver, but you apply weapon damage to the specified hit location instead of rolling.
