title:  "Charge Attack"
---
You make a melee attack with disadvantage at a target wheel. You may only use the Charge Attack maneuver immediately following an action in which you moved at least half of your movement speed in a straight line towards the target. 
* Failure and Critical Failure: Result depends on the targetâ€™s defensive maneuver.
* Success: The attack hits the target wheel, roll 1d12 to determine the location hit and apply weapon damage. Deal bonus damage equal to the number of 10-foot increments that you had as available movement when you started the straight line towards the target. For non-Light Thrusting weapons, the damage is based on 5-foot increments instead.
* Critical Success: You critically strike.
