title:  "Gap Thrust"
---
You make a melee thrusting attack at a target wheel, contested by the target’s defensive maneuver. You suffer disadvantage on this attack if using a Light weapon, double disadvantage if using a One- or Two-Handed weapon, or triple disadvantage if using an Oversized weapon.
* Failure and Critical Failure: Result depends on the target’s defensive maneuver.
* Success: The attack hits the target wheel, roll 1d12 to determine the location hit and apply weapon damage. You ignore AV provided by Segmented and Damaged armor as well as any Overlay armor on the target’s Face, Neck, Shoulders, Elbows, Groin, and Knees (or comparable hit locations on non-humanoid targets)
* Critical Success: As success, and you critically strike.
