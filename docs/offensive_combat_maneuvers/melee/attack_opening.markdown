You make a melee attack with advantage at a target and determine your target wheel as though making a ranged attack.
* Failure and Critical Failure: Result depends on the targetâ€™s defensive maneuver.
* Success: The attack hits the target wheel, roll 1d12 to determine the location hit and apply weapon damage.
* Critical Success: You critically strike.
